p9
aS"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."

p39
aS'Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?'
p40

p41
aS'Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman sobbing at 3 00 A.M., "I\'ll never have grandchildren, I\'ll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?'

p148
aS'Ooh, steer clear of you.'
p149
aS"That's right."
p150
aS"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I knowyou probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making lovewith your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,but it isn't me, it's not me.

aa(lp156
S"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
p157
aS"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
p158
aS"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
p159
aS"I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny."
p160

aa(lp167
S'Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?'

aS'Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...'
p170
aS"It's okay..."
p171
aS'I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?'
p172
aS'Two years.'

S"Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!"
p179
aS"Grab a spoon. Do you know how longit's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anythingto you?"
p180
aS'Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,'
p181
aS"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
p182
aS"Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here."
p183
aS"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
p184
aS"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
p185
aS'That is amazing.'
p186
aS'Congratulations.'
p187

And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy.

p333
aS"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
p334
aS'Oh, yeah!'
p335
aS'Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.'
p336
aS'Absolutely.'
p337
aS"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
p338
aS"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
p339
aS"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
p340
aS"Yeah, well, word of advice  Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
p341
aS'....Are we still talking about sex?'
p342
aa(lp343
S"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a littleangry?"
p344
aS'Well, she has issues.'
p345
aS'Does she.'
p346
aS"He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!"
p347
aS"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
p348
aS"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?"
p349
aS'No. No.'
p350
aS'Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!'
p351
aS"Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
p352
aS'Hi.'
p353
aa(lp354
S'So.'
p355
aS'You look great. I, uh... I hate that.'
p356
aS'Sorry. You look good too.'
p357
aS"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,uh..."
p358
aS'A lesbian?'
p359
aS"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
p360
aS"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-"
p361
aS'Why- why are you here, Carol?'
p362
aS"I'm pregnant."
p363
aS'Pregnant?!'
p364
aa(lp365
S"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
p366
aS"...Then I've already seen this one!"
p367
aS'Are you through with that?'
p368
aS'Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.'
p369
aS'Whose little ball of paper is this?!'
p370
aS"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead."
p371
aS"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!"
p372
aS"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have."
p373
aS"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
p374
aS"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way."
p375
aa(lp376
S"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come."
p377
aS"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born."
p378
aS'Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!'
p379
aS'What?'
p380
aS'Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!'
p381
aS'Eeaagh!'
p382
aS'Has anybody seen my engagement ring?'
p383
aS"Yeah, it's beautiful."
p384
aS'Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....'
p385
aS"No, look, don't touch that!"
p386
aa(lp387
S"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
p388
aS"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!"
p389
aS'Oh! Yeah!'
p390
aS"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
p391
aS'Doy! Probably right before she lost it!'
p392
aS"You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days..."
p393
aS'I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...'
p394
aS'...Dinah?'
p395
aS"Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
p396
aS"You didn't."
p397
aa(lp398
S'Oh, I am sorry...'
p399
aS'I gave you one job!'
p400
aS'Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!'
p401
aS"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
p402
aS"I just... can't do it."
p403
aS"Boys? We're going in."
p404
aS'.....Hi.'
p405
aS'Wow. That is not a happy hi.'
p406
aS"Carol's pregnant."
p407
aS'Ooh! I found it!'
p408
aa(lp409
S'W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...'
p410
aS'Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right aboutnow.'
p411
aS'Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?'
p412
aS'Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?'
p413
aS"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
p414
aS'She is so great! I miss her.'
p415
aS"What does she mean by 'involved'?"
p416
aS'I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.'
p417
aS'Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with themtomorrow.'
p418
aS'So what are you gonna do?'
p419
aa(lp420
S"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
p421
aS'.....Well, this is still ruined, right?'
p422
aS"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?"
p423
aS'Curry.'
p424
aS'Mmmm!'
p425
aS"I- I think they're great! I, I really do."
p426
aS"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?"
p427
aS'They all had a thing for him.'
p428
aS'Aw, Mom...'
p429
aS"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
p430
aa(lp431
S"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-"
p432
aS"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
p433
aS"Well, they don't have to know that..."
p434
aS'Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?'
p435
aS'Yeah.'
p436
aS"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
p437
aS'I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.'
p438
aS'What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.'
p439
aS"I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!"
p440
aS'Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...'
p441
aa(lp442
S"What's that supposed to mean?"
p443
aS"Nothing! It's an expression."
p444
aS"No it's not."
p445
aS"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
p446
aS"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer."
p447
aS"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem."
p448
aS"So, Ross, what's going onwith you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes toshare with the folks?"
p449
aS"Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realiseyou guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnantwith my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
p450
aS'And you knew about this?!'
p451
aS'Your folks are really that bad, huh?'
p452
aa(lp453
S"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done."
p454
aS"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours."
p455
aS'Must pee.'
p456
aS"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
p457
aS"You're twins?"
p458
aS"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
p459
aS'What does she do?'
p460
aS"She's a waitress."
p461
aS'All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.'
p462
aS"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
p463
aa(lp464
S'Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.'
p465
aS'The lights, please..'
p466
aS'...How long was I in there?'
p467
aS"I'm just cleaning up."
p468
aS"D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?"
p469
aS'Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!'
p470
aS'Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barrytomorrow?'
p471
aS'Oh.. a little..'
p472
aS'Mm-hmm..'
p473
aS'A lot.'
p474
aa(lp475
S'Mm.'
p476
aS"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
p477
aS"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
p478
aS"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
p479
aS'Got me.'
p480
aS'Remember when we were in high school together?'
p481
aS'Yeah.'
p482
aS"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?"
p483
aS'Yes, yes!'
p484
aS"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.."
p485
aa(lp486
S'Me either...'
p487
aS"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
p488
aS'Hi.'
p489
aS'Ross, you remember Susan.'
p490
aS'How could I forget?'
p491
aS'Ross.'
p492
aS"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So,uh, we're just waiting for...?"
p493
aS'Dr. Oberman.'
p494
aS'..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-'
p495
aS'She.'
p496
aa(lp497
S'-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?'

p499
aS"Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh."
p500
aS'Thanks.'
p501
aS'Quack, quack..'
p502
aS'Ross? That opens my cervix.'
p503
aS'Barry?'
p504
aS"C'mon in."
p505
aS'Are you sure?'
p506
aS"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
p507
aa(lp508
S'Huh?!'
p509
aS'So, how ya doin?'
p510
aS"I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!"
p511
aS'Yeah, well..'
p512
aS"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging."
p513
aS'Be right there.  Be backin a sec.'
p514
aS'I dumped him.'
p515
aS'Okay.'
p516
aS"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
p517
aS"Give me a 'for instance'."
p518
aa(lp519
S"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
p520
aS'Marlon-'
p521
aS'Marlon?!'
p522
aS"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
p523
aS'...As in Mouse?'
p524
aS'As in my grandmother.'
p525
aS'Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how aboutJulia?'
p526
aS'Julia..'
p527
aS'We agreed on Minnie.'
p528
aS"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
p529
aa(lp530
S'Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?'
p531
aS'Oh, not much. I-I got a job.'
p532
aS"Oh, that's great."
p533
aS'Why are- why are you so tanned?'
p534
aS'Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.'
p535
aS'Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?'
p536
aS'No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.'

p538
aS'No!  I went with Mindy.'
p539
aS'Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!'
p540
aa(lp541
S"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now."
p542
aS"Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!"
p543
aS"Careful! They haven't quite taken yet."
p544
aS"And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!"
p545
aS'Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.'
p546
aS'Okay..'
p547
aS"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist."
p548
aS'Wow.'
p549
aS"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit."
p550
aS'What?'
p551
aa(lp552
S'Me.'
p553
aS'Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.'
p554
aS'Well, thank you for giving it back.'
p555
aS'Hello?!'
p556
aS"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
p557
aS"Helen Geller? I don't think so."
p558
aS"Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller."
p559
aS'Thank you!'
p560
aS"No, I mean it's not Geller."
p561
aS"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
p562
aa(lp563
S'No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.'
p564
aS'Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?'
p565
aS"It's my baby too."
p566
aS"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
p567
aS'Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!'
p568
aS'All right, you two, stop it!'
p569
aS"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
p570
aS"Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse."
p571
aS"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
p572
aS"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!"
p573
aa(lp574
S"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
p575
aS'Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?'
p576
aS'Yeah. Yeah. A little.'
p577
aS'Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..'
p578
aS"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now."
p579
aS'Oh my God.'
p580
aS'Look at that.'
p581
aS'I know.'
p582
aS"Well? Isn't that amazing?"
p583
aS'What are we supposed to be seeing here?'
p584
aa(lp585
S"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
p586
aS'You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.'
p587
aS"Then don't do that, alright?"
p588
aS'Okay!'
p589
aS'Monica. Whaddya think?'
p590
aS'Mm-hmm.'
p591
aS'Wh- are you welling up?'
p592
aS'No.'
p593
aS"You are, you're welling up."
p594

aa(lp596
S"You're gonna be an aunt."
p597
aS'Oh shut up!'
p598
aS"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barrytoday. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, Ireally do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end upgetting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairlineand your old nose.   Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,but I feel so much better now."
p599
aS'Hi guys!'
p600
aS'Hey, Pheebs! Hi!'
p601
aS"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
p602
aS"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do thisagain!'"
p603
aS'Ohh. Ouch.'
p604
aS"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
p605
aS"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
p606
aa(lp607
S'Since when?'
p608
aS"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
p609
aS"Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'."
p610
aS"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
p611
aS'And everybody knows this?'
p612
aS'Yeah. Cushions the blow.'
p613
aS"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
p614
aS"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
p615
aS'Uh, Ross.'
p616
aS"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
p617
aa(lp618
S'"So how does it feel knowing you\'re about to die?"'
p619
aS'"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\'ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."'
p620
aS'Hey, that was really good!'
p621
aS"Thanks! Let's keep going."
p622
aS'Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"'
p623
aS'"I just wanna go back to my cell. \'Cause in my cell, I cansmoke."'
p624
aS'"Smoke away."'
p625
aS'I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.'
p626
aS'What?'
p627
aS'Relax your hand!'
p628
aa(lp629
S'Not so much!'
p630
aS'Whoah!'
p631
aS'Hey!'
p632
aS'Hey!'
p633
aS'Alright, now try taking a puff.'
p634
aS'Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.'
p635
aS'No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.'
p636
aS"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
p637
aS"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
p638
aS"Y'miss it?"
p639
aa(lp640
S'Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my..God.'
p641
aS"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
p642
aS"That's ridiculous!"
p643
aS'Can I use.. either thumb?'
p644
aS"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an icedtea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
p645
aS'Yeah. Yeah, excellent.'
p646
aS'Good for me!'
p647
aS"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
p648
aS"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
p649
aS'What did they do to you?'
p650
aa(lp651
S"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
p652
aS'Easy.'
p653
aS"- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account."
p654
aS"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
p655
aS"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
p656
aS'What are you talking about? Keep it!'
p657
aS"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be likestealing."
p658
aS'Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!'
p659
aS"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
p660
aS"We're with you. We got it."
p661
aa(lp662
S"Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt."
p663
aS'Chandler, what are you doing?'
p664
aS'Hey. Whaddya doing?'
p665
aS'Oh! Oh, God!'
p666
aS'What is this?!'
p667
aS"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
p668
aS"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
p669
aS'And this- is my reward!'
p670

p686
aS'Well, then can we meet him?'
p687
aS'Nope. Schhorry.'
p688
aS"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
p689
aS"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you  that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you."
p690
aS"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actuallyliked."
p691
aS'Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..'
p692
aS'Let it go, Ross.'
p693
aS"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
p694
aa(lp695

p714
aS"Loved him! Yeah! He's great!"
p715
aS"Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going outwith?"

aS'Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.'
p721
aS'Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!'
p722
aS'...What shoe?'
p723
aS"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
p724
aS'...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.'
p725
aS"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
p726
aS'Really!'
p727
aa(lp728
S"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?"
p729

p736
aS'Fantastic! I have one question  How is that possible?'
p737
aS'Alan.'
p738
aa(lp739
S'He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...'
p740
aS'I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.'
p741
aS'Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..'
p742
aS"Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.."
p743
aS'What?'
p744
aS'..I dunno, a little too Alan?'
p745
aS"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
p746
aS"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
p747
aS'I personally could have a gallon of Alan.'
p748
aS'Hey, Lizzie.'
p749
aa(lp750
S'Hey, Weird Girl.'
p751
aS'I brought you alphabet soup.'
p752

aS'Yes. But I left in the Ys. \'Cause, y\'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.'
p754
aS'Saltines?'
p755
aS'No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?'

p778
aS'Does, um, anyone wanna see?'
p779
aS'Nooo!'
p780
aS"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"

aS"It's worse than the thumb!"
p782
aa(lp783
S'Hey, this is so unfair!'
p784
aS'Oh, why is it unfair?'
p785
aS"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
p786
aS'...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?'
p787
aS'Well, I-I could live without it.'
p788
aS'Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews herhair?'
p789
aS"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
p790
aS'Oh,  "you do, do you"?'
p791
aS"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
p792
aS'"Indeed there isn\'t"... I should really get back to work.'

aS'Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?'
p797
aS'No.'
p798
aS"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
p799
aS'Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow gotthrough!'
p800
aS"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
p801
aS"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!"
p802
aS"I know.. it's gonna be really hard."
p803
aS"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
p804
aa(lp805
S"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
p806
aS'Do you have any respect for your body?'
p807
aS"Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?"
p808
aS"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
p809
aS"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
p810
aS"Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, shetold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it'snot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like thatbefore. Well, okay, thanks!"
p811
aS"God, he's good."
p812
aS'If only he were a woman.'
p813
aS'Yeah.'
p814
aS"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too."
p815
aa(lp816
S"Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch."
p817
aS"Hey. Where's Joey?"
p818
aS'Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that waswrong?'
p819
aS"I think he's across the hall."
p820
aS'Thanks.'
p821
aS"There y'go."
p822
aS"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
p823
aS'Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?'
p824
aS'Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?'
p825
aS'Hey, I might!'
p826
aa(lp827
S"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
p828
aS"You're kidding. Oh my God."
p829
aS'And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!'
p830
aS"What's goingon?"
p831
aS"Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together."
p832
aS'Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..'
p833
aS'Uh, Joey..'
p834
aS'Oh, God!'
p835
aS'Okay..'
p836
aS'Oh! That was Lambchop!'

p840
aS'Alright, we have to talk.'
p841
aS'There it is!'
p842
aS"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
p843
aS'Is there somebody else?'
p844
aS"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
p845
aS"We didn't change.."
p846
aS"So that's it? It's over? Just like that?"
p847
aS'You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-'
p848
aa(lp849
S'Look, I- I could go on pretending-'
p850
aS'Okay!'
p851
aS"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!"
p852
aS"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way theywere."
p853
aS"I'm sorry.."
p854
aS"Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"

aS"What's going on with you?"
p902
aS'I got no sleep last night!'
p903
aa(lp904
S'Why?'
p905
aS"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!"
p906
aS'Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.'

aS'Thanks.'

p935
aS'I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?'
p936
aa(lp937
S"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally--not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
p938
aS'Oh, this is not that bad.'
p939
aS"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job."

p952
aS"Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!"
p953
aS"I know. I know! I'm a duplex."
p954
aS"So what's going on with you?"
p955
aS"Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?"

p971
aS"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine."
p972
aS"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff."
p973
aS"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
p974
aS'Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!'
p975
aS"Alright. Let's talk reality for a second."
p976
aS'Okay.'
p977
aS'When are you coming home?'
p978
aS"What? Guys, I'm not."
p979
aS"C'mon, this is us."
p980
aa(lp981
S"I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-"
p982

p987
aS"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"

S"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa cardpeople."
p993
aS'Oh, God, ask them what they want.'
p994
aS"Could you please tell me whatthis is in reference to?  Yes, hold on.  Um, they say there's beensome unusual activity on your account."
p995
aS"But I haven't used my card in weeks!"
p996
aS"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay."
p997
aS"They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
p998
aS'Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?'
p999
aS"Alright, c'mon!  Let's play Twister!"
p1000
aS'Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.'
p1001
aS'What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?'
p1002
aa(lp1003
S"No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost..."
p1004
aS"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit."
p1005
aS"You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!"
p1006
aS'Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?'
p1007
aS'You are just like Jack.'
p1008
aS'...Jack from downstairs?'
p1009
aS'No, Jack and the Beanstalk.'
p1010
aS'Ah, the other Jack.'
p1011

aS"Excuse me, look, we've been here for overan hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy withthe toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said somethings we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!"

p1088
aS'I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.'
p1089
aS'Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?'
p1090

p1092
aS"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
p1093
aS'Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?'

aS"Ohhh... I'm fine."
p1160
aS"Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal."
p1161
aS"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
p1162
aS'Come on! You guys can pee standing up.'
p1163
aS"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
p1164
aS'Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.'
p1165

p1172
aS'Oh, right, right, shut up.'
p1173
aS'Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.'
p1174
aS"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
p1175
aS'Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.'
p1176
aS"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
p1177
aS"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."

aS'Tony?'

p1183
aS'Does anybody want anything else?'
p1184
aS"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
p1185
aS"What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?"
p1186
aS"It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible."
p1187
aS'That guy, he burns me up.'
p1188
aS"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady."

p1191

p1192
aS'Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You\'ll never make it on your own".'
p1193
aS'Uh-huh, uh-huh.'
p1194
aS'Hi, Joey.'
p1195
aS'My god, Angela.'
p1196
aS'Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.'
p1197
aS'Are you gonna go over there?'
p1198
aS"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela."

p1207
aS'Who?'
p1208
aS"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
p1209
aS"Don't you have a laundry room in your building?"
p1210
aS"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
p1211
aa(lp1212
S'Sure.'
p1213
aS"Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now."
p1214
aS"Bob? Who the hell's Bob?"
p1215

p1216
aS'Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.'
p1217
aS"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?"

aS"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
p1231
aS"What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls."
p1232
aS'I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?'
p1233
aa(lp1234
S"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonnabe me and Rachel."
p1235
aS"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thingthrough?"
p1236

p1350
aS"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"

p1500
aS"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?"
p1501
aS"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff  all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
p1502
aS'Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?'
p1503
aS'No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.'

p1507

p1508
aa(lp1509

p1511
aS"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"

p1525
aS"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."

aS"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
p1535
aS'Why not?'
p1536
aS"Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice."
p1537
aS'I could do that.'
p1538
aS"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
p1539
aS'Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.'
p1540
aS"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."

Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"

aS'She may have died?'
p1980
aS"We're looking into it."
p1981
aS"I, uh, I'll go see."
p1982
aS'This almost never happens!'
p1983
aS"Now she's passed."
p1984
aS'I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?'
p1985
aS"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
p1986
aS'Yeah, you have homosexual hair.'
p1987
aS'So, um, did she...'
p1988
aa(lp1989
S'Twice.'
p1990
aS'Twice?'
p1991
aS'Oh, that sucks!'
p1992
aS'You guys okay?'
p1993
aS"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,uh..."
p1994
aS"Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone."
p1995
aS"Nono, she's gone."
p1996
aS'We checked. A lot.'
p1997
aS"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
p1998
aS'Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?'
p1999
aa(lp2000
S'Thanks!'
p2001
aS'Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.'
p2002
aS"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you'redead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay,huh?"
p2003
aS"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
p2004
aS'I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.'
p2005
aS"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
p2006
aS'Sweetie, you think you can get in there?'
p2007
aS"I don't see why not."
p2008
aS"Here's my retainer!"
p2009
aS'I was just thinking. When my time comes-'
p2010
aa(lp2011
S'Dad!'
p2012
aS'Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.'
p2013
aS'You what?'
p2014
aS'I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.'
p2015
aS'Define fun.'
p2016
aS"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
p2017
aS'...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.'
p2018
aS"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
p2019
aS"That's probably what they'll say."
p2020
aS"I'd like that."
p2021
aa(lp2022
S'Hey, gorgeous.'
p2023
aS"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
p2024
aS"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
p2025
aS'Oh! Okay! Phew!'
p2026
aS'So, uh... what do you think it is about me?'
p2027
aS'I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...'
p2028
aS'...Quality, right, great.'
p2029
aS"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a greatcouple."
p2030
aS"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
p2031
aS"What? He's cute!"
p2032
aa(lp2033
S"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
p2034
aS'Is Brian...?'
p2035
aS"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
p2036
aS"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
p2037
aS"Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not."
p2038
aS'This one?'
p2039
aS'No.'
p2040
aS'I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.'
p2041
aS"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrongone."
p2042
aS"You're right. We'll go with the burgundy."
p2043
aa(lp2044
S"Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out."
p2045
aS'Wait! We need shoes!'
p2046
aS'Okay. Um, how about these?'
p2047
aS"That's really a day shoe."
p2048
aS"And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?"
p2049
aS'Could we see something in a slimmer heel?'
p2050
aS'Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.'
p2051
aS'No, it really should be burgundy.'
p2052
aS'Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?'
p2053
aS'No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.'
p2054
aa(lp2055
S'Oh my God..'
p2056
aS'Is everything all right, dear?'
p2057
aS'Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.'
p2058
aS'How we doing, you guys ready?'
p2059
aS'Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?'
p2060
aS"Some days it's all I can think about."
p2061
aS"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
p2062
aS'Oh, you-you mean your earrings?'
p2063
aS"What'd I say?"
p2064
aS'Hm-m.'
p2065
aa(lp2066
S'Are these the shoes?'
p2067
aS'Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.'
p2068

p2069
aS'Morning. We ready to go?'
p2070
aS"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn'tit?"
p2071
aS'It was a really beautiful service.'
p2072
aS"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream."
p2073
aS'What?'
p2074
aS'Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.'
p2075
aS'Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.'
p2076
aa(lp2077
S"You're watching a football game at a funeral?"
p2078
aS"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
p2079
aS'You are a frightening, frightening man.'
p2080
aS'Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!'
p2081
aS"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
p2082
aS'God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!'
p2083
aS"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-"
p2084
aS'God! Ross!'
p2085
aS"I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..."
p2086
aS"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh."
p2087
aa(lp2088

p2090

p2093
aS'Oh, no-'
p2094
aS"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
p2095
aS"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."

p2116
aS'Beautiful!'
p2117
aS'Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?'
p2118
aS'Your grandmother would have hated this.'
p2119
aS'Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.'
p2120
aa(lp2121
S"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
p2122
aS'That sounds like Nana.'
p2123
aS"Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?"
p2124
aS'...I can imagine.'
p2125
aS"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is."
p2126
aS'That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?'
p2127
aS'Tell her what?'
p2128
aS'How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.'
p2129
aS"I'm not sure I know what you're getting at."
p2130
aS"Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her thetruth?"
p2131
aa(lp2132
S"...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along."
p2133
aS'Huh.'
p2134
aS'More wine, dear?'
p2135
aS'Oh, I think so.'
p2136
aS'Those earrings look really lovely on you.'
p2137
aS"Thank you. They're yours."
p2138
aS"Actually they were Nana's."
p2139
aS"Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was."
p2140

p2141
aS'That little naked guy would be me.'
p2142
aa(lp2143
S'Aww, look at the little thing.'
p2144
aS'Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?'
p2145
aS'Who are those people?'
p2146
aS'Got me.'
p2147
aS"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
p2148
aS'Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?'
p2149
aS"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
p2150
aS'Looks like a fun gang.'
p2151
aS'Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!'

S'Hey, Lowell.'
p2155
aS'Hey, Chandler.'
p2156
aS"So how's it going there in Financial Services?"
p2157
aS"It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?"
p2158
aS"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
p2159
aS"I know. That's what I told her."
p2160
aS'Really.'
p2161
aS'Yeah.'
p2162
aS'So- you can tell?'
p2163
aS'Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.'
p2164
aa(lp2165
S"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
p2166
aS"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is."
p2167
aS'He is?'
p2168
aS'Yup, and waaay out of your league.'
p2169
aS'Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian.'
p2170
aS"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
p2171
aS'An advance?'
p2172
aS"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
p2173
aS"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
p2174
aS"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that."
p2175
aa(lp2176
S"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
p2177
aS'Huh?'
p2178
aS"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go."
p2179
aS'Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?'
p2180
aS"No, they're not."
p2181
aS'Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.'
p2182
aS"You're wrong."
p2183
aS'I am not wrong.'
p2184
aS"You're wrong."
p2185
aS'No, I just talked to them.'
p2186
aa(lp2187

p2188
aS'Hey, hey.'
p2189
aS'Hey.'
p2190
aS'Hey.'
p2191
aS'And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?'
p2192
aS'Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.'
p2193
aS"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
p2194
aS'What were you modeling for?'
p2195
aS'You know those posters for the city free clinic?'
p2196
aS'Oh, wow, so you\'re gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthyguys"?'
p2197
aa(lp2198
S'You know, the asthma guy was really cute.'
p2199
aS"Do you know which one you're gonna be?"
p2200
aS'No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...'
p2201
aS'Good luck, man. I hope you get it.'
p2202
aS'Thanks.'
p2203
aS"Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving."
p2204
aS"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's."
p2205
aS'Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?'
p2206
aS"You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
p2207
aS'Yeah.'
p2208
aa(lp2209
S'And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrimholidays.'
p2210
aS'Yes, every single one of them.'
p2211
aS"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
p2212
aS"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
p2213
aS"So you're free Thursday, then."
p2214
aS'Yeah. Oh, can I come?'
p2215
aS"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
p2216
aS'Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.'
p2217
aS'I thought it was $98.50.'
p2218
aS'Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.'
p2219
aa(lp2220
S"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
p2221
aS"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
p2222
aS"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
p2223
aS'Hi, is uh, is Carol here?'
p2224
aS"No, she's at a faculty meeting."
p2225
aS'Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan:Come in.'
p2226
aS'Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.'
p2227
aS"What's it look like?"
p2228
aS'Kinda like a big face without skin.'
p2229
aS"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
p2230
aa(lp2231
S"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
p2232
aS"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let youdo it."
p2233
aS'Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.'
p2234
aS"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
p2235
aS"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...crazy?"
p2236
aS"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
p2237
aS"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
p2238
aS'Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.'
p2239
aS'Do you uh, do you talk about me?'
p2240
aS'Yeah, yeah, all the time.'
p2241
aa(lp2242
S'Really?'
p2243
aS'But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.'
p2244
aS"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this."
p2245
aS"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
p2246
aS"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
p2247
aS'Hey, Rach, did you make your money?'
p2248
aS'No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.'
p2249
aS"Rach, here's your mail."
p2250
aS'Thanks, you can just put it on the table.'
p2251
aS"No, here's your mail."
p2252
aa(lp2253

p2258
aS'You owe me 20 bucks.'
p2259
aS'Thank you. Thank you so much!'
p2260
aS"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
p2261
aS"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
p2262
aS"All right, I'm nine years old."
p2263
aa(lp2264
S'Oh, I hate this story.'
p2265
aS"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
p2266
aS'Oh my god.'
p2267
aS"Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse."
p2268
aS'Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.'
p2269
aS'We did?'
p2270
aS"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?"
p2271
aS'Yeah, right.'
p2272
aS"I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business."
p2273
aS'Get out.'
p2274
aa(lp2275

p2278
aS'Nothing.'
p2279
aS'Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?'
p2280
aS'Yeah.  Oh.'
p2281
aS"What's wrong?"
p2282
aS'I just remembered, I have to do something.'
p2283

p2284
aS'Um, leave.'
p2285
aa(lp2286
S'Wait, wait, wait!'
p2287
aS'So I guess you all saw it.'
p2288
aS'Saw what?'
p2289
aS'No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.'
p2290
aS'Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.'
p2291
aS'Tonight, on a very special Blossom.'
p2292
aS"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?"
p2293
aS"I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen."
p2294
aS"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stopmoping."
p2295
aS"That's closer."
p2296
aa(lp2297
S'I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,shoop.'
p2298
aS'Oh, you must stop shooping.'
p2299
aS"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
p2300
aS'Chandler, will you just come in already?'
p2301
aS'No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.'
p2302
aS'Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!'
p2303
aS"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
p2304
aS"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
p2305
aS"That's not a question."
p2306
aS"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
p2307
aa(lp2308
S"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
p2309
aS"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
p2310
aS'Ah!'
p2311
aS'Ok, Mom never hit.'
p2312
aS'Ok, all done.'
p2313
aS'What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!'
p2314
aS"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
p2315
aS'Why would we do that?'
p2316
aS"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
p2317
aS'Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.'
p2318
aa(lp2319

Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I..."

p2413
aS'The bigger half.'
p2414
aS"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know thisisn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has beenreally great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been withyour family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivingssucked."

p2446
aS"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
p2447

p2467
aS"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling."
p2468

p2477
aS'Yeah!'

p2479
aS"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonnaask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break thepact."

p2495
aS'Do you always have to bring him here?'
p2496
aS"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
p2497
aS"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
p2498
aS"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
p2499
aS"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
p2500
aS"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."

aS'Yuh.'
p2503
aa(lp2504
S'Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?'
p2505
aS"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
p2506
aS'Sure.'
p2507
aS"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
p2508
aS"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."

aS'I can hop.'
p2518
aS"So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?"
p2519
aS"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."

aS"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?"
p2607
aS"Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf."

aS'Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!'
p3309
aS'Hey, how long are you in the city?'
p3310
aS"Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one."
p3311
aS'Oh, this is my friend Roger.'
p3312
aS'Hi.'
p3313
aS'Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.'
p3314
aS'You too, sir.'
p3315
aS'What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?'
p3316
aS'Dad, dad.'
p3317
aa(lp3318
S"Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say somethingfunny!"
p3319
aS"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real latenow"
p3320
aS"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?"
p3321
aS"Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician."
p3322
aS'Sure. So how long you been...'
p3323
aS'Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?'
p3324
aS'Since then?!'
p3325
aS"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memoryin your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever beenin love?"
p3326
aS"...I d'know."
p3327
aS"Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes."
p3328
aa(lp3329
S"You're one to talk."
p3330
aS"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
p3331
aS"Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma."
p3332
aS"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
p3333
aS"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!"
p3334
aS"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
p3335
aS'What?  What?'
p3336
aS'Did you not get a good enough look the other day?'
p3337
aS"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
p3338
aS"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
p3339
aa(lp3340
S"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
p3341
aS"Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'"
p3342
aS'Hello?'
p3343
aS"It's Phoebe."
p3344
aS'And Rog.'
p3345
aS"C'mon up."
p3346
aS'Oh, good. Rog is here.'
p3347
aS"What's the matter with Rog?"
p3348
aS'Yeah.'
p3349
aS"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
p3350
aa(lp3351
S"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
p3352
aS"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
p3353
aS'I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.'
p3354
aS'Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?'
p3355
aS"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you..."
p3356
aS'Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.'
p3357
aS"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
p3358
aS"That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!"
p3359
aS"Oh! So you think I'm a failure!"
p3360
aS"Isn't he good?"
p3361
aa(lp3362
S"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
p3363
aS"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
p3364
aS'Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!'
p3365
aS"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in."
p3366
aS"That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going."
p3367
aS"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
p3368
aS"Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
p3369
aS'Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.'
p3370
aS"You're welcome."
p3371
aS"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
p3372
aa(lp3373
S'Hate that guy!'
p3374
aS'Night, you guys.'
p3375
aS"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
p3376
aS'Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?'
p3377
aS"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
p3378
aS"I'm Joey Tribbiani."
p3379
aS"Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
p3380
aS"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
p3381
aS"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
p3382
aS'Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.'
p3383
aa(lp3384
S"That's a good one!"
p3385
aS'Hey, Joe.'
p3386
aS"Dad, Ronni's here."
p3387
aS'Huh?'
p3388
aS'Hi.'
p3389
aS"Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?"
p3390
aS"Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting."
p3391
aS'Thank you. Uh...'
p3392
aS"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
p3393
aS"Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train."
p3394
aa(lp3395
S"I don't want you taking that thing."
p3396
aS"Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
p3397
aS'Who-ah-ho.'
p3398
aS"We'll go to a hotel."
p3399
aS"We'll go to a hotel."
p3400
aS"No you won't."
p3401
aS"No we won't."
p3402
aS"If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you."
p3403
aS"You're gonna keep an eye on us?"
p3404
aS"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
p3405
aa(lp3406
S"Wow. He's strict."
p3407
aS"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
p3408
aS"Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid."
p3409
aS'C\'mon, I\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\'s not followed by "No thanks, it\'s late."'
p3410
aS'Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.'
p3411
aS'What kinda change?'
p3412
aS'Well, either you break it off with Ronni'
p3413
aS"I can't do that!"
p3414
aS'Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!'
p3415
aS'Yeah, but this is'
p3416
aa(lp3417
S"I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!"
p3418
aS"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
p3419
aS"Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear."
p3420
aS"Well, you're gonna."
p3421
aS"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top ofgirls..."
p3422
aS'Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?'
p3423
aS"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
p3424
aS"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
p3425
aS'No.'
p3426
aS'No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\'t easy, but you did it! And I\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I\'m married."'
p3427
aa(lp3428
S'You really think so?'
p3429
aS'Yeah. I really do.'
p3430
aS'Thanks, Chandler.'
p3431
aS'Get off!'
p3432
aS'Hi.'
p3433
aS'Hi...May I help you?'
p3434
aS"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's inours?"
p3435
aS'Okay...who are you?'
p3436
aS"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
p3437
aS"Oh, c'mon in."
p3438
aa(lp3439
S'Thanks.'
p3440
aS"Hi, I'm Rachel."
p3441
aS'Hi.'
p3442
aS"Bathroom's up there."
p3443
aS'Great.'
p3444
aS"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in theshower?"
p3445
aS'Oh, like, uh, five minutes?'
p3446
aS"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib."
p3447
aS'Hey. Morning, dear.'
p3448
aS"Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing."
p3449
aa(lp3450
S"What's the matter with you?!"
p3451
aS'I thought it was Chandler!'
p3452
aS'What? What?'
p3453
aS'You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!'
p3454
aS'Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.'
p3455
aS'Hey, Pheebs.'
p3456
aS'Hey.'
p3457
aS"How's it going?"
p3458
aS"Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to inviteyou guys."
p3459
aS"So what's going on?"
p3460
aa(lp3461
S"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
p3462
aS"I dunno, there's just something about..."
p3463
aS"Basically we just feel that he's..."
p3464
aS'We hate that guy.'
p3465
aS'Yeah. Hate him.'
p3466
aS"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
p3467
aS"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
p3468
aS'...No, we hate him.'
p3469
aS"We're sorry."
p3470
aS"Ma! What're you doing here?"
p3471
aa(lp3472
S'I came to give you this  and this.'
p3473
aS'Oww! Big ring!'
p3474
aS"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really."
p3475
aS'Hold on, you-you knew?'
p3476
aS'Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should\'ve heard some of his cover stories. "I\'m sleeping over at my accountant\'s," I mean, what is that? Please!'
p3477
aS'So then how could you I mean, how could you?!'
p3478
aS"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."
p3479
aS"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
p3480
aS"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
p3481
aS"I'm...happy...for you?"
p3482
aa(lp3483
S"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was."
p3484
aS"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
p3485
aS'I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did yousee her?'
p3486
aS"Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is."
p3487
aS"That's sweet. Could I take her?"
p3488
aS'With this ring?  No contest.'
p3489
aS"What's wrong, sweetie?"
p3490
aS'Nothing, nothing.'
p3491
aS"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon."
p3492
aS"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
p3493
aa(lp3494
S"Oh. They don't."
p3495
aS"But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."
p3496
aS'What?'
p3497
aS'Intense and creepy.'
p3498
aS'Oh.'
p3499
aS"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
p3500
aS"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
p3501
aS"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
p3502
aS"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
p3503
aS'So you talked to your dad, huh.'
p3504
aa(lp3505
S"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
p3506
aS'Wow.'
p3507
aS'Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.'
p3508
aS'So Joey, you okay?'
p3509
aS"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
p3510
aS'Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.'
p3511
aS"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
p3512
aS'Hey.'
p3513
aS'Hey, Pheebs.'
p3514
aS"How's it going?"
p3515
aa(lp3516
S'Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.'
p3517
aS'Awww.'
p3518
aS'Yeah, right.'
p3519
aS'Aaawwwwww!!'
p3520
aS'What happened?'
p3521
aS"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
p3522
aS"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
p3523
aS'Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop  Rachel Green.'
p3524
aS'Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!'
p3525
aS'Sorry. Wrong boobies.'
p3526
aa(lp3527
S'Hello, Joey.'
p3528
aS'Oh! ...Hello, dear.'
p3529
aS"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
p3530
aS'She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.'
p3531
aS'Any contact?'
p3532
aS'She lent me an egg once.'
p3533
aS"You're in!"
p3534
aS'Aw, right.'
p3535
aS'Hi, Ross.'
p3536
aS'Hey.'
p3537
aa(lp3538
S"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian-I don't think we need a third..."
p3539
aS'Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.'
p3540
aS'An egg?'
p3541
aS'Yeah, you\'re gonna go up to her and say, "Here\'s your egg back, I\'m returning your egg."'
p3542
aS"I think it's winning."
p3543
aS"I think it's insane."
p3544
aS"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
p3545
aS"Think it'll work?"
p3546
aS"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
p3547
aS'You can not do this.'
p3548
aa(lp3549
S'Do what, do what?'
p3550
aS'Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.'
p3551
aS"No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?"
p3552
aS"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
p3553
aS'But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.'
p3554
aS'Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?'
p3555
aS'Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.'
p3556
aS'Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...'
p3557
aS"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
p3558
aS'Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...'
p3559
aa(lp3560
S"Pathetic mess? I know, but-come on, man, she's needy, she'svulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'this."
p3561
aS'Hi. She said yes.'
p3562
aS'Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?'
p3563
aS'How do I look?'
p3564
aS"Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
p3565
aS'Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.'
p3566
aS'...And what did you bring?'
p3567
aS"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
p3568
aS'Janice?'
p3569
aS'Oh.... my.... God.'
p3570
aa(lp3571
S"Hey, it's Janice."
p3572
aS"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
p3573
aS"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
p3574
aS"Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!"
p3575
aS"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
p3576
aS"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
p3577
aS'Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.'
p3578
aS'Which one was Pete Carney?'
p3579
aS'Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  "Was it good for you?"'
p3580
aS'Yeah, well, I\'ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy.  "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months-I didn\'t get to win once.'
p3581
aa(lp3582
S"How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!"
p3583
aS"I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets."
p3584
aS"I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch."
p3585
aS"There's more beer, right?"
p3586
aS'Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.'
p3587
aS'Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.'
p3588
aS"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
p3589
aS'Ok, well, what kind of ritual?'
p3590
aS'Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.'
p3591
aS'Or?'
p3592
aa(lp3593
S'Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.'
p3594
aS"Burning's good."
p3595
aS"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
p3596
aS"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes."
p3597
aS'Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?'
p3598
aS'By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.'
p3599
aS"That's OK."
p3600
aS'Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.'
p3601
aS"We can't do that."
p3602
aS"What? What can't you do?"
p3603
aa(lp3604
S'Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?'
p3605
aS'Uh, we might be leaving now.'
p3606
aS'Tell me it\'s "you and me" we.'
p3607
aS"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
p3608
aS'Ok, you can not do this to me.'
p3609
aS"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
p3610
aS'Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?'
p3611
aS"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,Chandler."
p3612
aS'I hope she throws up on you.'
p3613
aS'So...'
p3614
aa(lp3615
S'Just us.'
p3616
aS'Oh, what a crappy night!'
p3617
aS"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom."
p3618
aS"Excuse me.  How ya doin'?"
p3619
aS'So, do we have the best friends or what?'
p3620
aS"Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"
p3621
aS'I will go for that drink.'
p3622
aS'You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?'
p3623

p3643
aS"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call."
p3644
aS"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?"
p3645
aS"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
p3646
aS"That's funny. Who are they?"
p3647
aa(lp3648
S'The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.'
p3649
aS"You mean they're lovers."
p3650
aS'If you wanna put a label on it.'
p3651
aS'Wow, uh, anything else I should know?'
p3652
aS"Nope, nope, that's it."
p3653
aS"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!"
p3654
aS'Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.'
p3655
aS'All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.'
p3656
aS"Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
p3657
aS"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
p3658
aa(lp3659
S'Can we just start throwing things in?'
p3660
aS'Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.'
p3661

p3677
aS'So, um, what do you do for a living?'
p3678
aS"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
p3679
aS'Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.'
p3680
aa(lp3681
S"I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry."
p3682
aS"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
p3683
aS'I guess.'
p3684
aS'Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?'
p3685
aS"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
p3686
aS"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
p3687
aS'What do we got there?'
p3688
aS"A piece of something  boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture-Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
p3689
aS"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
p3690
aS"It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control."
p3691
aa(lp3692
S"You're our third call tonight."
p3693
aS'Really?'
p3694
aS"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."

aS'I brought you something.'
p3696
aS'Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.'
p3697
aS'I had them made special.'
p3698
aS"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
p3699
aS"That's fine."
p3700
aS'It is?'
p3701

p3702
aa(lp3703
S'Oh no, you see, actually it is.'
p3704
aS"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing."
p3705
aS"Oh, no I don't."
p3706
aS"Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?"
p3707
aS'I did, but...'
p3708
aS"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
p3709
aS'Call me!'
p3710
aS"It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine."
p3711
aS'You did so. I swear, I swear- How long has she been in the bathroom?'
p3712
aS"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
p3713
aa(lp3714
S"Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years."
p3715
aS'That could be it.'
p3716
aS'Oh, god.  You know, this is stillpretty hot.'
p3717
aS"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
p3718
aS'No, it\'s just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\'s, that\'s it. And um, and then I\'m here talkin\' to you, and, and it\'s easy, and it\'s fun, and, and I don\'t, I don\'t have to...You know, here\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you\'re gonna say, you\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\'re great together, you know. You can\'t deny it. Besides, you\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin\' that, but there\'s somethin\' right here. I love you.'
p3719
aS'Oh, I love you too. But...'
p3720
aS'No but, no but.'
p3721
aS"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time totake the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waitingfor you."
p3722
aS"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
p3723
aS"All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set."
p3724
aa(lp3725
S'Not her.'
p3726
aS"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
p3727
aS'So, um, will you bring the truck?'
p3728
aS"I'll even let you ring the bell."
p3729
aS'Oh, my god.'

aS'See, there you go, the cleansing works!'
p3731

p3741
aS'And a nice hot cider for Monica.'
p3742
aS'Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?'
p3743
aS'Yeah?'
p3744
aS'Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?'
p3745
aS"Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!"
p3746
aa(lp3747
S'Chandler.'
p3748
aS"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
p3749
aS'Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.'
p3750
aS'Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.'
p3751
aS"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
p3752
aS'Hey!'
p3753
aS'Hey!'
p3754
aS'Never mind. But it was going to be really good.'
p3755
aS"What's going on?"
p3756
aS'What is it?'
p3757
aa(lp3758
S"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
p3759
aS"That's great!"
p3760
aS'So.... I quit.'
p3761
aS'Why?'
p3762
aS'Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!'
p3763
aS"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
p3764
aS"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
p3765
aS'So was it a lot more money?'
p3766
aS"It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
p3767
aS'... the WENUS?'
p3768
aa(lp3769
S'Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.'
p3770
aS'Oh. That WENUS.'
p3771
aS"So what're you going to do?"
p3772
aS"I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there."
p3773
aS"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
p3774
aS'Um... hi there.'
p3775
aS"Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
p3776
aS"Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant."
p3777
aS'Yeah, yeah!'
p3778
aS'Well, what kind of food is he looking for?'
p3779
aa(lp3780
S"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
p3781
aS'Oh my God!'
p3782
aS'Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?'
p3783
aS"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
p3784
aS'OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!'
p3785
aS'Can you see my nipples through this shirt?'
p3786
aS"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
p3787
aS'Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?'
p3788
aS'Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."'
p3789
aS'Career counselor?'
p3790
aa(lp3791
S'Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.'
p3792
aS"I don't!"
p3793
aS"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
p3794
aS'Ah, the lesser-known "I don\'t have a dream" speech.'
p3795
aS'Oh, I love my life, I love my life!'
p3796
aS"Ooh! Brian's Song!"
p3797
aS'The meeting with the guy went great?'
p3798
aS"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
p3799
aS'Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?'
p3800
aS"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
p3801
aa(lp3802
S'What are you going to make?'
p3803
aS'Yummy noises.'
p3804
aS'And Monica, what are you going to make?'
p3805
aS"I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!"
p3806
aS"Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with thestuff?  You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know."
p3807
aS'Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?'
p3808
aS"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
p3809
aS"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
p3810
aS'Who are you going out with?'
p3811
aS'Oh, is this the bug lady?'
p3812
aa(lp3813
S'Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.'
p3814
aS"Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at themuseum."
p3815
aS'So what are you guys going to do?'
p3816
aS"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
p3817
aS"And he's not speaking metaphorically."
p3818
aS'So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?'
p3819
aS"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh."
p3820
aS"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
p3821
aS"Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
p3822
aS"I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my..."
p3823
aa(lp3824
S'Alright...'
p3825
aS'OK, try this salmon mousse.'
p3826
aS'Mmmm. Good.'
p3827
aS'Is it better than the other salmon mousse?'
p3828
aS"It's creamier."
p3829
aS'Yeah, well, is that better?'
p3830
aS"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
p3831
aS'My God! What happened to you?'
p3832
aS'Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."'
p3833
aS"That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!"
p3834
aa(lp3835
S"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
p3836
aS'Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!'
p3837
aS"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
p3838
aS"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
p3839
aS"It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche."
p3840
aS'Well.... it is amouz-ing...'
p3841
aS"Hello?  Oh, hi Wendy!  Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK, great.  Allright, I'll see you then. Bye."
p3842
aS'Ten dollars an hour for what?'
p3843
aS"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
p3844
aS'Waitressing?'
p3845
aa(lp3846
S'Uh-oh.'
p3847
aS'Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...'
p3848
aS'But, but?'
p3849
aS"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
p3850
aS"Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics."
p3851
aS"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76.  Amouz-bouche?"
p3852
aS'Talk to me.'
p3853
aS'OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...'
p3854

aS'Um... uh.... vulva.'
p3863
aS'Vulva?'
p3864
aS"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
p3865
aS'Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??'
p3866
aS"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
p3867
aa(lp3868
S"What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me."
p3869
aS'Please be kidding.'
p3870
aS"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
p3871
aS"OK.  I'm in my apartment..."
p3872
aS'....yeah... what else?'
p3873
aS"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation."
p3874

Well, that's very generous  er, but look,this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something Ican really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure youmentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This isnot a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'mtelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you onMonday!"

p5063
aS'No, none at all.'
p5064

p5559
aS"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."

p6416
aS'No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned somethingabout asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what elsedid he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?'
p6417
aS"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn'tmind getting a cup of coffee or something."
p6418
aa(lp6419
S"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him."
p6420
aS"H-He's in China!"

aS"I-I-I don't know."
p6428
aS"Well then maybe you shouldn't go."
p6429
aa(lp6430
S"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's thekind of thing that can wait."
p6431
aS"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
p6432
aS"I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him."
p6433
aS'Here, look, alright, does this help?'
p6434
aS"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...OK, I'll see you later."

p6509
aS'Oh, why?'

p6521
aS"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like Ilearned something."
p6522
aS"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
p6523
aS'What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walkaround like this?'
p6524
aS"I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupidelectric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not againstenvironmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!"
p6525

aS'Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.'
p6535
aS"Ross, it's too hard."
p6536
aS"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who caresabout them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninthgrade."

Ross was in love withRachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind ofgot in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget abouther" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was inlove with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meethim when he came back, but what she didn\'t know was, that Ross was getting off the planewith another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that\'s pretty much everything you need to know. But, enoughabout us. So, how\'ve you been?'

aS"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'msorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all byhimself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
p6642
aS'How is that the silver lining?'

p6755
aS'Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?'

p6757
aS"I don't know, I don't know."
p6758
aa(lp6759
S"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've beenwith like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone theway Ross felt about you."
p6760
aS'Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!'

p6769
aa(lp6770
S"That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measurepants?"
p6771
aS'Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?'
p6772
aS"What? That's not?  Oh my God."
p6773

p6775
aS'Thank you. My hair is very amused.'
p6776
aS"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught betweenthe moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
p6777
aS'Thank you.'
p6778
aS'Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.'

Someone whowakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I\'m with Rachel". You know, someonewho makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?'
p6794
aS'No, I think that was the whole all.'
p6795
aS'Okay. Okay.  Okay.'
p6796
aS"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."

aa(lp6957
S'My breast milk is gross?'
p6958
aS'This should be fun.'
p6959
aS"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults."

p6973
aS'Howdy.'
p6974
aS'Gimme a box ajuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.'
p6975
aS"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
p6976
aS"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more peopleon it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goesthrough two bottles a day."
p6977

p6994
aS"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."

p7017
aS'Really? Me?'

p7083
aS"Yeah, I just don't buy it."
p7084

p7086
aS"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"

p7096
aS"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one,you be noisy girl number two."
p7097

Now, are you telling me that you are sounbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that youcould be wrong about this?"

p8470
aS'Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.'
p8471
aS"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think aboutyourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the worldnot only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
p8472
aS'No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.'
p8473
aa(lp8474
S"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don'tgo!"
p8475
aS"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there'snothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
p8476
aS"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list."
p8477
aS'Maybe a littlelonger.'
p8478
aS"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh,like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, andfour cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
p8479
aS"Doesn't matter."
p8480
aS'What?'
p8481

p8491
aS'Look, can, can you do something for me?'
p8492
aS'Sure, what? Ok, ok.  Music?'
p8493
aS"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he'sdeeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him."
p8494
aS"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It'spretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Whydon't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hityou with her car and she hopes you two will work it out."
p8495
aa(lp8496
S'Hi, thanks for coming in again.'
p8497
aS'Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.'

aS'Cat hair.'
p8500
aS'Oh, sorry.'

p8508
aS'Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.'
p8509
aS'And twenty-five it is.'
p8510
aS'You gave him cookies?'
p8511
aS"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we'rebroke, but cookies do say that."
p8512
aS'I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.'
p8513
aS'Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?'
p8514
aS'Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.'

p8531
aS'Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?'

aS"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame."
p8554
aS"No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you."
p8555
aS'Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.'
p8556

aS"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame."
p8583
aa(lp8584
S'Oh God.'

p8586
aS"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, hedoesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
p8587
aS'Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.'
p8588
aS'OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?'
p8589
aS'Honey.'
p8590
aS'Oh.'
p8591
aS"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this.  This is the real him."
p8592
aS'Oh.'
p8593
aS"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big blackboots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody tosee him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
p8594
aa(lp8595

aS"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
p8612
aS'Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.'

p9105
aS'As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?'
p9106
aS"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
p9107
aS"Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding."
p9108
aS'Look I just thought that...'
p9109
aS"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say aboutme if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!"

aS'Uh-huh.'
p9115
aS"This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television."
p9116
aS"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then Istarted thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
p9117
aS"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, andshe's in a full body cast."
p9118
aS'Yes!'
p9119
aS"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never cateredbefore, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
p9120
aS'Would it matter?'
p9121
aa(lp9122
S'Oh, you are so great!  Thank you!'
p9123
aS'Are you really not going?'
p9124
aS"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do theyneed to get married?"
p9125
aS'They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people thatare close with them.'
p9126
aS'If you wanna call that a reason.'
p9127
aS"Who's thebitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor."
p9128
aS'Ross, I thought you were over this.'
p9129
aS"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she weremarrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
p9130
aS"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
p9131
aS'Did I miss it? Did I miss it?'
p9132
aa(lp9133
S"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself."
p9134
aS"Whoa, she's pretty."
p9135
aS"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras,and smell-the-fart acting."
p9136
aS"I'm sorry, what?"
p9137
aS'What?'
p9138
aS"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need aminute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pausewhere you look all intense, you know, like this."
p9139
aS'Oh, ok.'
p9140
aS'There\'s my scene, there\'s my scene.  "Mrs. Wallace, I\'mDr. Drake Ramoray, your sister\'s neurosurgeon.'
p9141
aS'Is she gonna be all right?'
p9142
aS"I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is sufferingfrom a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee."
p9143
aa(lp9144
S'Nice!'
p9145
aS"That's great!"
p9146
aS'Excellent!'
p9147
aS"For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something."
p9148
aS'That is so good! Do it again!'
p9149
aS'All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it\'s right there on thechart!"'
p9150
aS"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone toinspect."
p9151
aS"No no, that's me."
p9152
aS'Oh, yeah.'

aS'Oh, hello.'
p9154
aa(lp9155
S"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
p9156
aS'Is everything ok?'
p9157
aS'Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.'
p9158
aS'Oh my god.'
p9159
aS"That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get."
p9160
aS'Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.'
p9161
aS'Oh, honey.'
p9162
aS'Yeah, it\'s just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought,"ok, I\'ll have some breakfast, and then I\'ll take a little walk, and then I\'ll havemy massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that\'s it." Oh,but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when thespirit left her body, I don\'t think it went very far.'
p9163
aS'What do you mean?'
p9164
aS'I think it went into me.'
p9165
aa(lp9166
S"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck."
p9167
aS"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been calledSilence of the Ducks."
p9168
aS'Ok, who ordered what?'
p9169
aS'Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.'
p9170
aS'Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?'
p9171
aS'Oh god.'
p9172
aS"I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'."
p9173
aS"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to thinkthat because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
p9174
aS'Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedmantell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.'
p9175
aS"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
p9176
aa(lp9177
S"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  Sit up!"
p9178
aS'There she is.'
p9179
aS'Mom!'
p9180
aS"Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room?Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun."
p9181
aS'Pretty much.'
p9182
aS'Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.'
p9183
aS'This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.'
p9184
aS'Oh hello, Ross.'
p9185
aS'Hi, Mrs. Green.'
p9186
aS'So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?'
p9187
aa(lp9188
S'Oh Mom!'
p9189
aS"If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink."
p9190
aS'Believe me, sometimes that happens.'
p9191
aS"This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from myfather's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you."
p9192
aS'Really?'
p9193
aS'Yes.'
p9194
aS"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before shegot the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales."
p9195
aS"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
p9196
aS"I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?"
p9197
aS"Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello."
p9198
aa(lp9199
S"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument."
p9200
aS'You have some life here, sweetie.'
p9201
aS"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barryand get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this isjust so much better for me, you know?"
p9202
aS"I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look atyou and I think, oh, this is what I want."
p9203
aS'For...me.'
p9204
aS'Well, not just for you.'
p9205
aS'Well, what do you mean?'
p9206
aS"I'm uh, considering leaving your father."
p9207
aS'All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding,chicken breasts.'
p9208
aS"Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick."
p9209
aa(lp9210
S"Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them."
p9211
aS"And you had no idea they weren't getting along?"
p9212
aS'None.'
p9213
aS"They didn't fight a lot?"
p9214
aS"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know theywere having problems?"
p9215
aS'In my day, divorce was not an option.'
p9216
aS"Hey, look who's up."
p9217
aS"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody'sparents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry aboutthis."
p9218
aS"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she'sdoing it because she wants to be more like you."
p9219
aS"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?"
p9220
aa(lp9221
S"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to thisshrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in yourcase it's actually kinda true."
p9222
aS"That's him."
p9223
aS"Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet."
p9224
aS'Phoebe?'
p9225
aS'Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.'
p9226
aS"Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting."
p9227
aS'Um, do you wanna sit?'
p9228
aS'Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what canI do for you, my dear?'
p9229
aS"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left herbody, it um, kind of stuck around in me."
p9230
aS"You're saying, my wife is in you?"
p9231
aa(lp9232
S"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinishedbusiness she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?"
p9233
aS"Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is thatshe always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything."
p9234
aS'Everything?'
p9235
aS'Everything.'
p9236
aS"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
p9237
aS'Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.'
p9238
aS"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
p9239
aS'Worth a shot, huh?'
p9240
aS'Look at this.'
p9241
aS'These are from Halloween three years ago.'
p9242
aa(lp9243
S"Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?"
p9244
aS"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as aregular dentist."
p9245
aS'Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don\'t reallyneed your help"?'
p9246
aS'Actually, what I think you said was, "don\'t touch that, and get the hellout of my kitchen."'
p9247
aS"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and Iplanned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actuallydo it."
p9248
aS'Hey, Mon, you want some help?'
p9249
aS'If you want.'
p9250
aS'Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of ModernArt, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.'
p9251
aS"She's still with you?"
p9252
aS"Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to goto the bathroom again.  Oh, such a pretty face."
p9253
aa(lp9254
S'This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Doesanybody have any marijuana?'
p9255
aS'God!'
p9256
aS"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food."
p9257
aS"That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?"
p9258
aS"Oh! What's new in sex?"
p9259
aS"The only man I've ever been with is your father."
p9260
aS"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything."
p9261
aS'I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking theremight be more.'
p9262
aS"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean,god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What?What do you want? Do you want my blessing?"
p9263
aS'No.'
p9264
aa(lp9265
S'You want me to talk you out of it?'
p9266
aS'No.'
p9267
aS'Then what? What do you want?'
p9268
aS'I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.'
p9269
aS'Why on earth would I understand this?'
p9270
aS"You didn't marry your Barry. I did."
p9271
aS'Oh.'
p9272
aS"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutesleft. Move, move, move!"
p9273

p9275
aa(lp9276
S"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!"
p9277
aS'Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.'
p9278
aS'Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?'
p9279
aS'Sir! No sir!'
p9280
aS'All right, you!'
p9281
aS'No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.'
p9282
aS'All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, andI feel for you, I do. But if you don\'t help me cook, I\'m gonna take a bunch of thoselittle hot dogs, and I\'m gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". Allright, ball the melon.'

p9289
aS"What's the matter?"
p9290
aS"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding."
p9291
aS'What?'
p9292
aS"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish."
p9293
aS"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
p9294
aS"My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming."
p9295
aS'Oh my god.'

p9297
aa(lp9298
S"It's ok. I'm sorry."
p9299
aS"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should calloff the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, andif I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what todo."
p9300
aS"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
p9301
aS'You do?'
p9302
aS"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
p9303
aS'Of course I do.'
p9304
aS"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hellwith them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stoppedme. Look, this is your wedding. Do it."

aS"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn'tmean he's great in bed."
p22765
aS"We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likesto agree with him a lot."
p22766
aS"Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna begreat, \xc2\x91cause you-you guys are in love."

aS"I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe."
p22792
aa(lp22793
S'Why not?'
p22794
aS"Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I reallydon't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make youunderstand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,"

p22801
aS'Okay.'
p22802
aS"I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, andI only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terribleit is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret everysingle day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, itwould be like a million times harder to give up a child.  I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first."
p22803
aa(lp22804
S"All right, I'm sorry."
p22805

Hey, when I'm in a play andyou're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know,it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow."

And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease,it's-uck! Hah?"

That's what we did!We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tieredwedding cake , with the little people on top.  Thanks.

p32488
aS"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"

aS'And somebody took a shot at me!'
p32495
aS'Really?!'
p32496
aS"No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebodywas taking a shot at me. And Rach, I..I survived! And I was filled with this-thisgreat respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize everyopportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now."
p32497
aS'Because a car backfired?'
p32498
aS'Okay, why are you here?'
p32499
aS'Well, I-I-I don\'t know how this fits into your whole "seizing"thing but um, Emily called you today.'
p32500
aS'You talked to her?'
p32501
aa(lp32502
S"No, she left a message.   Butit-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine."
p32503
aS'Well, okay, what-what did she say?'
p32504
aS'Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding anddid you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.'
p32505
aS'Wow!'
p32506
aS'Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?'
p32507
aS'Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!'
p32508
aS"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Becausey'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Yourdecision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision."
p32509
aS'Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.'
p32510
aS"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you reallywant to get back into that?"
p32511
aS"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but myex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got tomean something!"
p32512
aa(lp32513
S'Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barelyan experience!'
p32514
aS"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed toseize! Y'know?"
p32515
aS"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this isabout escaping stuff."
p32516
aS'Huh.'
p32517
aS"I mean, look-look today you escaped   death,y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together withEmily?"
p32518
aS"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-Ireally don't wanna see or talk to her."
p32519
aS'Well, there you go!'
p32520
aS'Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.'

aa(lp32524
S'Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.'

p32534
aa(lp32535
S"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really agood story."
p32536
aS"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-butheavy fire, like I was in a war or something."
p32537
aS'Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make afantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of youguys.'
p32538
aS'Before or after you were shot by your own troops?'
p32539
aS'I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting allof us.'
p32540
aS'Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.'
p32541
aS'Yeah, hero sandwiches.'
p32542

aS"I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!"
p32575
aS'Me?! Why me?'
p32576
aS'Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make himscared like you! Make him a..man!'
p32577
aS"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'ma lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."

p34389
aS"Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that noneof us know anything about?"
p34390
aS'Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about herall the time! DENISE!!!!!'
p34391
aS"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra roomover at my place.."

aS"You didn't tell her did you?"
p34402
aS'No.'
p34403
aS"Of course not, because you're in love with her."
p34404
aa(lp34405
S"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out soI eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.I-I just comforted her, as a friend."
p34406
aS'What do you mean, comforted her?'
p34407
aS"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug."
p34408
aS'Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!'

p34412
aS'Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?'
p34413
aS'S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?'
p34414
aS"Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of herhead! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in lovewhen they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you're ascientist."
p34415
aa(lp34416
S"I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got inmy face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh..coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybeit means I have feelings for coconuts!"
p34417
aS"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, allright? Rachel's not in the same place you are."
p34418
aS'If the place you are referring too is being inlove, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!'
p34419
aS"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's\xc2\x91cause you were speaking the secret language of love!"
p34420
aS'Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.'
p34421
aS'Who was it?'
p34422
aS'I don\'t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."Jeez!'
p34423
aS"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna beempty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
p34424
aS'Sure!'
p34425
aS"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? Witha mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we couldhave a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they lovedstaying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much."
p34426
aa(lp34427
S"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe itcould be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like SpaceInvaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!"
p34428
aS'No.'
p34429
aS'Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interestingidea. Let\'s discuss it before we reject it completely."'
p34430
aS"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talkabout it, but no."
p34431
aS"So, that's it?"
p34432
aS"I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. Thebeautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques."
p34433
aS"Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!"
p34434
aS'What do you have against the beautiful guest room?'
p34435
aS"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room,especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
p34436
aS'Are you mocking me?'
p34437
aa(lp34438
S"No, I'm not mocking you,  or you beautifulguest room."

aS"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came outtoday."
p34442
aS'"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,non-ugly." Nice!'
p34443
aS"Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be aninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learnfrom, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different thanme; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!"
p34444
aS'Pheebs, I have to ask you..'
p34445
aS"Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now."
p34446
aS"You're just staring into space."
p34447

S'This one?'
p34450
aS'It worked!'
p34451
aS'Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place Ican afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It\'sjust, there is nothing! The city\'s full!'
p34452
aS'Wait, no, look at this!   "Two bedroom,two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay.." Oh, yeah, but it\'s onthe ground floor.'

aS'Hey.'
p34455
aS'Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?'

p34458
aS"That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I loveWarren! Thank you!"
p34459
aa(lp34460

p34461
aS'Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thankyou!'
p34462
aS'Okay, you go grab it!'
p34463
aS'I saw it.'
p34464
aS"I don't know what you're talking about."
p34465
aS"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won'tadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!"
p34466
aS'Look, I do not re-love her.'
p34467
aS"I can't believe you won't just admit it!  Okay, justpromise me that you won't do anything stupid."
p34468
aS"Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?"
p34469

aS"Oh please!   You're gonna say things now,aren't ya?"
p34485
aS"No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thinghappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to herand he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! Andthat's how she ended up living with me!   Okay,that's a lie."
p34486

aa(lp34493
S'Ohh.'
p34494
aS"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think ofsomething to do with the room together."
p34495

p34496
aS'Totally!'
p34497
aS"We don't have to come up with this now."
p34498
aS'Oh good.'
p34499

p34500
aS'Changes?'

p34508

p34534
aS"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known youboth a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy asyou've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all awayover a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"

p34987
aa(lp34988
S'What do you mean?'
p34989
aS"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be incharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they puttheir hands around.."
p34990
aS'That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.'
p34991
aS"Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."

S'Shocking! Since you still have the keys.'
p35000
aS"You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People arefriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice aboutmy equity investments."
p35001
aS'What equity investments?'
p35002
aS"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But Ifigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start tothink that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got abucket and some soap I can borrow?"

S"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up."
p35022
aS"But it's my car!"
p35023
aS"Yeah, but it's my wax."
p35024
aS"Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so Idon't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could Ihave my keys."
p35025
aS"Sure. Here.  I'll uh, save your parking spot."

aS'I live upstate.'
p35029
aS'Yeah, so did I.'
p35030
aS"I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't knowwhy Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy."
p35031
aa(lp35032
S"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same."
p35033
aS'Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, theycan meet Krog!'
p35034
aS"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!"
p35035
aS'He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!'
p35036
aS"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, lookat his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up."
p35037
aS"They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
p35038
aS'What?!'
p35039
aS'Glass, sand, whatever.'
p35040
aS'Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.'
p35041
aS"Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being ableto put both legs over your head."
p35042
aa(lp35043
S'Oh, I can still do that.'
p35044
aS'How are you still single?!'
p35045
aS"All right.  I thought about it and maybeyou're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy."
p35046
aS'Good. What made you change your mind?'
p35047
aS'I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.'
p35048
aS'How did that happen?!!'
p35049
aS"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And itturns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat."
p35050
aS"Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watchingthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!"
p35051
aS'Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?'
p35052
aS'Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.'
p35053
aa(lp35054
S'So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the groundsthat Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.'
p35055
aS"Fine, I'm mentally unstable."
p35056
aS'And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.'
p35057
aS'What?!'
p35058
aS'Uh yes, heroin and crack.'
p35059
aS"Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!"
p35060
aS'Well, you would know.'
p35061
aS'Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference beforemarriage?'
p35062
aS'Oh, come on!'
p35063
aS'Ross, please, I found the magazines!'
p35064
aa(lp35065
S"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, thatmakes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin."
p35066
aS"Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin,I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
p35067
aS"That won't be necessary."
p35068
aS'And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!'
p35069
aS'Ugh!'
p35070
aS'Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that reallycreates a problem.'
p35071
aS'Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from therecord?'
p35072
aS'Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?'
p35073
aS'Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.'
p35074
aS"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for anannulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce."
p35075
aa(lp35076
S"That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did withyour funny, funny form!"
p35077
aS'What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated likebunnies nonsense!'
p35078
aS"And what--What are youtyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don'ttype that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!"
p35079
aS"Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping memarried too?!"
p35080
aS'You need to get out of my chambers.'
p35081
aS'All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and Iam not leaving here until I get one!'
p35082
aS'Yeah!'
p35083
aS'Would you like to spend the night in jail?'
p35084
aS'And thank you for your time.'
p35085
aS'So the Porsche guy took hiscar back.'
p35086
aa(lp35087
S'But you found the keys to his clothes?'
p35088
aS'No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks Iown a Porsche.'
p35089
aS"And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing theclothes?"
p35090
aS"Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have thecar! Right?"
p35091
aS'That is true.'
p35092
aS'Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.'
p35093
aS"Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
p35094
aS"Joey, you know you don't actually have one."
p35095
aS"Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk toher!"
p35096

p35097

p35100
aS"The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own fora while!"
p35101
aS"But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team!We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!"
p35102
aS"He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got togo to the hospital."
p35103
aS"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's justgonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
p35104
aS"I think that's gum."
p35105
aS"I'm pretty sure it's gun."
p35106
aS"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go."
p35107
aS"A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?"
p35108
aa(lp35109
S"Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?"
p35110
aS"Maybe because you've got the keys?"
p35111
aS'Porsche.'
p35112
aS'This is totally your fault!'
p35113
aS'My fault?! You threatened the judge!'

aS"You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out.\xc2\x91Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!"
p35137
aS'Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!'

p35159
aS"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything,but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in thecasino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and Ithought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided firstto get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got usinto this mess."
p35160
aS'So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all  yourfault.'

And that's goodtoo. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because Ilike .. maintaining you."
p37099
aS"I didn't even tell him to saythat. . All right you're off my list."
p37100

p40695
aS"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don'treally believe that do you?"
p40696
aS"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage isunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigsdon't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in alifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!"
p40697
aS"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!"
p40698
aS"If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what thedivorce rate in this country is? 97%."
p40699
aS'Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may neverwant to get married?'
p40700
aS"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never."

p40706
aS"We're gonna find love!"
p40707
aS'Definitely!'
p40708
aS"Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it soeasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a littleguarantee though."
p40709
aS'What do you mean?'
p40710
aS"Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neitherof them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other."
p40711
aS'You mean a backup?'
p40712
aS'Exactly!'
p40713
aS'Yeah, yeah I got that.'

p41313
aS"Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of mybook. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little..erotica. It's just ahealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand."

p41343
aS"Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't puta price on that sweetie."
p41344

p41346
aS'What about when I started dating Chandler?'
p41347
aS"Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd everpropose!"
p41348
aS'Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.'
p41349
aS"I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!"
p41350
aS"We might still have some money, if your father didn'tthink it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet."
p41351
aa(lp41352
S'It seemed like such a simple idea.'
p41353
aS'Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.'

aS"All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler."
p41355
aS"Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you.  Ohh,that's soft."
p41356
aS"I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help payfor it?"
p41357
aS"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood."
p41358

p41366
aS"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we loveeach other and that we're gonna get married."
p41367
aS'Do you even understand what off the rack means?!'
p41368
aS"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?"

p41381
aS'Ah, yeah!'
p41382
aS"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and Ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."

p42927
aS"What? That's like insanely easy!"
p42928
aS"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at leastone, or in some cases... fourteen ."
p42929
aS"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, sotechnically I didn't lose."
p42930
aS'What? You forgot fourteen states?'

p42950

p42952
aS"Oooh that may be a New World's record"
p42953
aS'You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it\'s kinda disgraceful, that agroup of well-educated adults and Joey can\'t name all the states. Did you ever see a map,or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?'
p42954
aS'Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.'
p42955
aS"What? That's impossible."

p42960
aS'No, just give me another minute.'

p43017
aS'Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!'
p43018
aS"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5minutes, my throat will just close up!"
p43019
aS"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"
p43020
aS'Really?'
p43021
aS"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had areaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"
p43022
aS'Well, it still has to go, right?'

aa(lp43024
S'Why?'
p43025

aS"You don't like puppies?"
p43040
aS'Okay, you are new!'
p43041
aS"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It'slike Ross not likin' ice cream."
p43042
aS"You don't like ice cream?"
p43043
aS"It's too cold."
p43044
aS"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
p43045
aa(lp43046
S'It hurts my teeth.'
p43047
aS"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, Idon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!"

p43053
aS'Yeah.'
p43054
aS'When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amountof time to wait before you make a move?'
p43055
aS"Oh, I'd say about a month."
p43056
aa(lp43057
S"Really? I'd say 3 to 4."
p43058
aS'Half hour.'
p43059
aS'Interesting.'
p43060
aS"When it's your assistant, I would say never."
p43061
aS"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Becauseif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."
p43062
aS'Huh. A moo-point?'
p43063
aS"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo."
p43064
aS'Have I been living with him for too long, or didthat all just make sense?'
p43065
aS"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he'sobviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend."
p43066
aS"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do."
p43067
aa(lp43068

p43078
aa(lp43079
S'Yeah.'
p43080
aS'Yeah. Hmmmm.'

p43082
aS"No..Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you knowthat I figure it..it has to work out."

aS"No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said whathe said, because um, I'm attracted to you."

aS'Wow.'
p43098
aS"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that'scrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing Iwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would bereally great if you said something right about now."

aS'This is ridiculous.'
p43139
aS"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dognamed Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and herfriend..Phyllis..take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him.Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed."

p43175
aS"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tellyou something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be ableto eat something."

p44334
aS'What?'
p44335
aS'Oh yeah, like you never called!'

aS'Oh well, all right..um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.'
p44347
aS"They're always going to tell you they don't need toner,but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in thisscript."
p44348
aS'Oh.'

aS"So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any lastquestions?"
p44350

aS"Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?"
p44512
aS'Yeah.'
p44513
aS"I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replacedit with mine!"
p44514
aS"Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!"
p44515
aS'Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?'
p44516
aS'Noo!  Angels.'
p44517
aS"I'm gettin' my chair back!"
p44518
aS'What? Wh-hey!'
p44519
aa(lp44520
S"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guessthis chair is mine now!"
p44521
aS'Joey you broke my chair!!'
p44522
aS'Your chair?!'
p44523
aS'Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!'
p44524
aS'So, there was no miracle?!'
p44525
aS'No Joe, no miracle.'
p44526
aS"Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm soglad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life."
p44527
aS"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right?That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!"
p44528
aS'I think I should get the chair!'
p44529
aS'How do you figure?'
p44530
aa(lp44531
S"Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!"
p44532
aS"No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere."
p44533
aS"Well, where's the logic in that?!"
p44534
aS'The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough tobreak a chair in half!'
p44535
aS'So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!'
p44536
aS"That's right!"
p44537

p44548
aS"No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!"
p44549
aS'Why?!'
p44550
aS'Because it was fate that made me call you today!'
p44551
aS'I thought it was toner.'
p44552
aa(lp44553
S"No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job!Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody elsemight've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff.My mom killed herself."
p44554
aS'Really?!'
p44555
aS'Yes.'
p44556
aS'How?'
p44557
aS"I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see thatthis-this..this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this."
p44558
aS"Couldn't it just be a coincidence?"
p44559
aS"No, it's fate!"
p44560
aS"It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate."
p44561
aS"Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also asupply manager."

p44642
aS'How hot do I look in this, huh?!'

p44780
aS"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop."
p44781
aS"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to getpregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternityclothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.."
p44782
aS"Really! That long?!   Look all you want, it's happening!"
p44783
aa(lp44784
S"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That'sthree years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need ayear and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, yearand a half before we get engaged.. Which means I need to meet the guy by the timeI'm thirty."
p44785
aS'Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!'
p44786
aS'No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I shouldalready be with the guy I wanna marry!'

p44987
aS'Ms. Monroe..  Oh there you go.'
p44988
aS"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okaylook, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he hason his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. Andthen whoever does gets the phone."
p44989
aS'Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.'
p44990
aS"I don't think so."
p44991
aS"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'dbe singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
p44992
aa(lp44993
S'All right, first name on the speed dial ismom.'

aS"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barnis not too cold."
p46299
aS"Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uhit's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen anaked man who wasn't Jewish. So.."
p46300
aS'So..What?'
p46301
aa(lp46302
S"So uh well the director is insisting that whoever playthat part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?"

p46317
aS'Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learningto..grow a turtleneck!'

aS"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'mthinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."

aS"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The saltdidn't dissolve and is now.. lodged places. And the scents I used don'tcompliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!"
p51557
aS'What?'
p51558
aS"The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting."
p51559

p51561
aS'Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!'

p51563
aS'I had the exact same conversation.'
p51564
aS'You did? What was he talking about?'
p51565
aS"I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting outwords since we saw him in Macbeth!"
p51566
aS'That was a long night.'
p51567
aS"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"

aS'Okay, he was talking about rules.'
p51569
aS'Uh-huh.'
p51570
aa(lp51571
S'Umm, and looking at people differently.'
p51572
aS"He didn't say anything about that to me."
p51573
aS'What did he tell you?'
p51574
aS'He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, ofcourse the glue that holds this all together, the rules.'
p51575
aS'Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wantsto do what you and I did in London with someone.'
p51576
aS'But what did he mean by rules?'
p51577
aS'Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!'
p51578
aS'Because he was looking at her differently.'
p51579
aS'And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!'

p51581
aa(lp51582
S'You guys?'
p51583
aS"Just a minute!  That's Mrs. Tribbiani!"
p51584
aS"You don't say anything."
p51585
aS'Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start thegreatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could allstart having babies?'
p51586
aS"I'm not going to let you say anything."
p51587
aS'You just stay here!'
p51588
aS'Oh, God!'

p51619
aS"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh.. Wait aminute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. Youknow it's a boy!"
p51620
aS"I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name."
p51621
aS"I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get toname it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heathor Blaine or Sequoia."
p51622
aS'I would-Sequoia?'
p51623
aS'Veto.'
p51624
aS'Fine.'
p51625

I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then Ilied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for notbreaking up with me sooner, you know?"

aS"Y'know, I don't really know her."
p54853
aS"Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow."
p54854
aS'Are you kidding me?!'

aS'And so engaged.'
p54872
aS"What?  Oh my God! She-shethinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!"
p54873
aS"Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Rossdoctors are supposed to be smart."
p54874
aS"I didn't give her that ring!"
p54875
aS'Really?'
p54876
aS'No!'
p54877
aS'So whose ring is it?'

aS'No!!'
p54886
aS'Huh, I might be losing interest in this.'

aS'Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose toRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe..kinda..wantedah..start..things up again.'
p54888
aS'Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.'
p54889
aS"Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like shedidn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of thishappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
p54890
aS'No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.'
p54891
aa(lp54892
S"Well I didn't! I didn't propose!  Unless uh.. Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and..it does sound like something I woulddo."
p54893
aS"Look, we can't stay in here forever."
p54894
aS"Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn'tmake it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
p54895
aS"This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to beashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door."
p54896
aS'Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?'
p54897
aS"Of course. I'll always be your dad."
p54898
aS"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasn't for fun."
p54899
aS"It wasn't fun?!"
p54900
aS"Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why.. Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever wewant."
p54901
aS"Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you twohaving sex at all. It was a simpler time."
p54902
aa(lp54903
S"The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying."
p54904
aS'What?'
p54905
aS"Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant."
p54906
aS"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there!  I'll guard the door!"
p54907
aS"Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
p54908
aS"Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?"
p54909
aS'Daddy?!'
p54910
aS"Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I weretrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I gotmy bad hip."
p54911
aS"That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet holein my head."
p54912
aS'This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, shewas..'
p54913
aa(lp54914
S"Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positionsyou and mom had sex."
p54915
aS"You're right, you're right. This is about your positions.Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, althoughit might feel good."
p54916
aS"I don't feel good right now."
p54917
aS'But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the womanhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?'
p54918
aS'Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.'
p54919
aS'Hey.'
p54920

p54941
aS"Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it looklike?!"

aS'Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to  Mike.'
p55462
aS'I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.'
p55463

p55471
aS'Nothing, huh?'
p55472
aS"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.  They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're  looking for someone to shovel mesquite."
p55473
aS"'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy."
p55474
aS"'So Cheesy' also has an opening."
p55475
aS"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something."
p55476
aS"Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming  with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.  'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa."
p55477
aS"Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm  good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been  relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo   is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this  is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo   'I'll take it!'"
p55478

aS'You even have to ask?!    He is alive!'
p55485
aS"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have  known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
p55486
aS"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.  Mike hit my mom with a car."
p55487
aS"No, I didn't."
p55488
aS"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're  friends again everything's great!"

p55496
aS'Do you not know each other?'
p55497
aS"Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that  we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.  We played all kinds of games.  Hey, remember the one where I punch  you in the face for not being cool?!"
p55498
aS'Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters  does Joey have?'
p55499
aS'Six!'
p55500
aS'What are you doing? I said seven!    Argh!!!'
p55501
aS'Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?'
p55502
aa(lp55503
S"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
p55504
aS"I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his  mother with a car."
p55505
aS'You are unbelievable! I spent so much time  finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and  cute and loose.'
p55506
aS'Hey!'
p55507
aS'Who are you kidding?  You just find some  guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!'
p55508
aS"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like  this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!"

p55517
aS'What?'
p55518
aS"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,  Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa."
p55519
aS'How far outside?'
p55520
aS'Manhattan.'
p55521
aS"And you're thinking of taking it?  So before  you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now  it's old job,  me,  new job."
p55522
aS"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot  to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
p55523
aS"What happened to 'you can't live without me four  days a week'?"
p55524
aa(lp55525
S"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days  is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see  you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really  if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make  it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
p55526
aS'I think you should take the job.'
p55527
aS'Really?'
p55528
aS'Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you  start chattering like a monkey.'

p55535
aa(lp55536
S'Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?'
p55537
aS"He's a brilliant diagnostician!"
p55538
aS'Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?'
p55539
aS"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate  doctor."
p55540
aS"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's  a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
p55541
aS'Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer  in your touchy?'
p55542
aS'Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security  blanket to college!'
p55543
aS'That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!'
p55544
aS"It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!"
p55545

p55546
aa(lp55547
S'Sure.'
p55548
aS"I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm  a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny  guy."
p55549
aS'Why did you go along with that?'
p55550
aS"Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.  And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did."
p55551
aS"That's true.  Well, is anything you told me  about yourself true?"
p55552
aS'My name in Mike, and I do play piano.'
p55553
aS'Prove it.'
p55554

Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it's too late now."
p56075
aS"Well, ??? think that's us?"
p56076
aS'well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?'

aS'Well, what is going on with you two?'
p56078
aS"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating."
p56079
aS"Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
p56080
aS"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough."
p56081

p56088
aS'What?'
p56089
aS"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye."

p56098
aS'Do, do you gonna do it now?'

p56119
aS"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy,   Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt,   the funniest guy I have ever met."

aS'This is nice.'
p56121
aS'I know!'
p56122
aS'You need both hands for that?'
p56123
aS"Yeah, I kinda do.  Well,   how's this?"
p56124
aS"Aaahhh, look   at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?    Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me,   huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh"
p56125
aS"I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early   for us to be... having that conversation."
p56126
aa(lp56127
S'Is it?'
p56128
aS'Maybe not, is it?'
p56129
aS"Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this   way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet   someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have   this...  No, not... that's gum.  Ooh, five bucks...   I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there..."
p56130
aS"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
p56131
aS'Oh, sorry.'
p56132
aS"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the   five dollars."
p56133
aS"It's to my apartment."
p56134
aS'Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for   Phoebe and Mike.'
p56135
aS"Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have   to give me your key just because..."
p56136
aS'Oh no, I want to.'
p56137
aa(lp56138
S'Oh, thank God.'
p56139
aS"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never   meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go."
p56140
aS'Is this cool, huh?'
p56141
aS'It really is.'
p56142
aS'Oh, I know it... It   is amazing these little things open doors... huh!'
p56143
aS"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,   but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance   to know her."
p56144
aS"I think that's   really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better."
p56145
aS"That's great, great. So do you have any questions   for us?"
p56146
aS'Not really.'
p56147
aS'Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...'
p56148
aa(lp56149
S'Thank you.'
p56150
aS"Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you."
p56151
aS'Oh, you know, wait. I do have   one question.  Do you guys do random drug   testing?'
p56152
aS"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
p56153
aS"That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm   gonna need three days notice."
p56154
aS"Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny."
p56155
aS'Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews    And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider   the uhm... the first one we met with.'
p56156
aS'What, the blonde with no bra?'
p56157
aS"She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree   in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three   years."
p56158
aS'Okay...'

aS'Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?'
p56164
aS"No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW,   hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
p56165
aS"Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to   explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that   we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing."
p56166
aS'Who cares, it got you here.'
p56167
aS"Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got   on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your   address I... I... I didn't even think about it."
p56168
aS'Wow. Where is your luggage?'
p56169
aS'Damn it!'
p56170
aa(lp56171
S"A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company."
p56172
aS"Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you   just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression,   uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that   means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!"
p56173
aS'Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually,   no, I look pretty good.'
p56174
aS"Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see   someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and   you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful,   but... well, you are.  Well, so, uhm... are you seeing...   anyone?"
p56175
aS'No...'
p56176
aS"I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How   can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?"
p56177
aS"Maybe he didn't give you a chance."
p56178
aS'He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...'
p56179
aS'Oh, well... That had been your window.'
p56180
aS"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking,   I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's   here. He's just, he's so irresistible."

S'Really? The scientist guy?'
p56183
aS'Really? Chandler?'
p56184
aS'Continue...'
p56185
aS"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him   that I would see him tomorrow night."
p56186
aS'Phoebe!'
p56187
aS"I know!  Evil! And... and... and...   I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
p56188
aS"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the   same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
p56189
aS'Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given   my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.'
p56190
aS'What are you gonna do?'
p56191
aS"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that   nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated   moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
p56192
aa(lp56193
S'You have to tell David!'
p56194
aS'Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation   with Joey.'
p56195
aS"Funniest guy she's ever met!    I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock   jokes...  Save it for   inside!"
p56196
aS'Heeeeeey!'
p56197
aS'Hey!'
p56198
aS'Hey!'
p56199
aS"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they   call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma   having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from   the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
p56200
aS'Was your cabin   pressurised?'
p56201
aS"And don't get   me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk."
p56202
aS'Okay.'
p56203
aa(lp56204
S"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two   words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,   I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried   chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
p56205
aS'No, it just remind me of something this guy did today   at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?'
p56206
aS'Yeah, he came up...'
p56207
aS'Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,   but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.'
p56208
aS'Were you there?'
p56209
aS'No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...'
p56210
aS"I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave   your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your   heart..."

p56218
aS"Oh, that's pretty."
p56219
aS"So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?"
p56220
aS"I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people,   but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is   take care of a child."
p56221
aS'Okay.'
p56222
aS"Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three   weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...   When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...  That was his name for me... I'll see you every day...   right in..."

p56231
aS'Why?'
p56232

p56233
aS'Yes?'
p56234
aS'King?'
p56235
aS"I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made   lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that   rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young..."

aa(lp56237
S"Please?  YES! Sandy you're hired."
p56238

p56326
aS"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...?   Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey..."
p56327
aS"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing...   You know, like Ross's thing is..."
p56328
aS'Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?'
p56329
aS'...No...'

p56352
aS"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on,   you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the   girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me."

p56372
aS'Allright... But... if I ever do come back   from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.'
p56373
aS"Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd   better watch out."
p56374
aS"Oh, you're going to Minsk?"
p56375
aS'Well, I might.'
p56376

p56394
aS'Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed   to appreciate puppets?'
p56395
aS'Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours   help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.'

p56429

p56430
aS'Oh, damn you Geller!'
p56431
aS"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
p56432

p56438
aS"Why... I... I don't know.    Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?"
p56439
aS'hmmm...'

p56443
aS'That must have been hard.'
p56444
aS'It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom...   playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father   walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things?   What\'s wrong with you, why aren\'t you... why aren\'t you outside playing like   a... like a real boy?'
p56445

You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know   that? But you've got...  You've got big beautiful eyes...   Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.  Big baby   butt! I like big butts.  I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other   brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and   a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're   laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done   that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What?   What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want   none / unless you got buns hon...    I'm a terrible father!"

p56469
aS'Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.'
p56470
aS'Yeah! Right!  People eat   birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you   go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I\'ll have a bucket of fried   bird."  Or... or maybe just a wing or...'
p56471
aS"Joey, I think you should consider something a little   less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The   Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.    That's right, I know some stuff!"
p56472
aS'Real estate, huh? Hmmm...'
p56473
aS"Oh, and you know who's selling a great   apartment? Richard!"

p56482

p56486
aS'Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".'
p56487
aS'Oh God, neither!'

p56489
aa(lp56490
S'Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I\'m   so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a   little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer,   I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."'
p56491
aS'You went out with Wallis Pincer?'
p56492
aS"Uh, he took the SAT's for me."

p56494
aS'Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...'
p56495
aS"So... now... What about with Mike's mom?"
p56496
aS"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell   her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time   actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
p56497
aS'She said WHAT?'

p56504
aS'You WHAT? And I missed it? Because   I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?'
p56505
aS'Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person   laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...    Only... only not creepy.'
p56506
aS'Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?'
p56507
aS'I uhm... Well, I sang...  well actually   I rapped... Baby Got Back...'
p56508
aS'You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song   about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?'
p56509
aS'But you know what, if you think about it, it actually   promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm...   juicy doubles.'

p56516
aS"Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's   got a great view of Central Pa....."
p56517
aS"mmm That's enough about you!"
p56518
aS'Is there anything we should know about the apartment?'
p56519
aS'All the appliances are included. There is a lot   of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...'
p56520
aS"No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together.   We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple."
p56521

p56522
aa(lp56523
S"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not   good enough for you?"
p56524
aS"We're not gonna have this conversation again...   Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this   huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about   losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you?"
p56525
aS"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see   I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah,   I could see it."

I actually lived in a   burned out Buick LeSabre for a while...  which was okay,   that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit   in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm...   a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money   but at least I don't pay taxes, huh...

aS"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
p56594
aS'Did you take that tape?'
p56595
aS"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and   you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need   to know what was on it?"
p56596
aS"I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?"
p56597
aS'Some girl...!?'
p56598
aS'She hot?'
p56599
aa(lp56600
S'Yeah...!?'
p56601
aS'How did she get me to settle down?'
p56602
aS"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's   probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly   be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?"
p56603
aS"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes   to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
p56604
aS"Then you're gonna have to watch it for me."
p56605
aS'What? Whoo... What?'
p56606
aS'Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is...   Please?'
p56607
aS'All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only   yourself to blame...'
p56608
aS'Why am I hearing cheering?'
p56609
aS"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
p56610
aa(lp56611
S'Football? Just football?'
p56612
aS'Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.'
p56613
aS"It's football... It's just football... This is great!   This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to   get a beer...    What the...    What are you doing?"
p56614
aS"You don't wanna see what I just saw!"
p56615
aS'What are you guys doing?  Oh my God, is that Richard?'
p56616
aS"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please?   Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty   rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My   name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't   rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I   know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I   like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when   a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and   I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing!   Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little   weirdo..."
p56617
aS'Hey!'
p56618
aS'Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing.   It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...'
p56619
aS"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her   to laugh?"
p56620
aS'Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ...   I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...'
p56621
aa(lp56622
S"You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?"
p56623
aS'Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...'
p56624
aS"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly   cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song...   I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen   minutes."
p56625
aS'Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that   one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?'
p56626
aS'Oh, Pervert Parade?'
p56627
aS'No...'
p56628
aS'Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?'
p56629
aS'Stop!'
p56630
aS'Oh God! Is that veal?'
p56631
aS"Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian."
p56632
aa(lp56633
S'Oh!'
p56634
aS"Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I   mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love..."
p56635
aS"Phoebe you don't have to eat..."
p56636
aS"No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens,   fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat   running through it...    Hmmm... yummy  Hmmm..."
p56637
aS'So...? What do you think?'
p56638
aS"So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?"
p56639
aS'Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn   star!'
p56640
aS'That tape was never meant to be seen by...    Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.'
p56641
aS"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have   any secrets anymore...  Not ready to joke about   it yet, okay, I see you later."
p56642
aS'Why in the world would you take this tape and and   why would you watch it?'
p56643
aa(lp56644
S"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature   man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd   be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and   moustaches."
p56645
aS'Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?'
p56646
aS"This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not   over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants."
p56647
aS"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that   is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him."
p56648
aS"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a   moustache!"
p56649
aS"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each   other. That's all that matters."
p56650
aS'Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling   around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...'
p56651
aS"Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole   life!"
p56652
aS"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how   it ends."
p56653
aS"THAT'S NOT ME!"
p56654
aa(lp56655
S"What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride   'em cowgirl!"
p56656
aS'That bastard taped over me!'
p56657
aS'Is that a problem?'
p56658
aS"I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank   tape, Doctor!"
p56659
aS"I can't imagine what he sees in her."
p56660
aS'She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife   of his.  Oh, hello dear...'
p56661
aS"Hey, what's going on?"
p56662
aS"We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?"
p56663
aS'A little better.'
p56664
aS"By the way, do you know who's moving back into town?   Tom and Sue's daughter Jen."
p56665
aa(lp56666
S"You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well   behaved and... single."
p56667
aS"I'm not interested."
p56668
aS"Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all   the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real..."
p56669
aS"All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight   is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time,   but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are..."
p56670
aS'Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!'
p56671
aS"So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't   bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept   the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love..."
p56672
aS'The woman you what?'
p56673
aS'Yeah... The woman you what?'
p56674
aS"The woman I love...  I love you...   Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my   parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've   ever met in my life..."
p56675
aS'I love you too...'
p56676
aa(lp56677
S'You do?'
p56678
aS'YEAH...! How great is this...?'
p56679
aS'Wanna get out of here?'
p56680
aS'Okay.'
p56681
aS'Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.'
p56682
aS"I had a great time.  It was really top drawer.   And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in   the coat closet... Ta taaa..."
p56683
aS"She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette."
p56684
aS'So fellas'
p56685
aS'Yeah!'
p56686

p56687
aa(lp56688

p56690
aS'Hell yeah!'
p56691
aS'So shake it!'
p56692
aS'Shake it!'
p56693
aS'Shake it!'
p56694
aS'Shake it!'
p56695
aS'Shake that nasty butt...'
p56696
aS'Baby got back'
p56697
aS'One more time from the top... I like big butts   and I cannot lie, you other br...'
p56698
aa(lp56699
S'Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!'
p56700
aS'Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?'
p56701
aS"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our  wedding china today?"
p56702
aS'No, I think we should save our china for something  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.'
p56703
aS'Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.'
p56704
aS"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive."
p56705
aS'What is the point of having them if we never use  them?'
p56706
aS'Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen  comes over..'
p56707
aS'I will explain it to her.'
p56708
aS"<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you  talk to the queen."
p56709
aa(lp56710
S'wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those  horses can crap.'
p56711
aS'Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.'
p56712
aS"Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo  hoo!"
p56713
aS'And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap  Days of Our Lives .'
p56714
aS'Oh my God!'
p56715
aS"Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime  soap Days of Our Lives?"
p56716
aS"Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm."
p56717
aS'What are you going to do?'
p56718
aS'I guess I\'m going to have to come up with a really  good reason why I wasn\'t there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.  They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00  AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.'
p56719
aS'Well you proved them wrong.'
p56720
aa(lp56721
S'Yeah.'
p56722
aS"Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What  are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies."
p56723
aS'A lot of people are thankful for those.'
p56724
aS'Hello? Rachel?'
p56725
aS'Who is it?'
p56726
aS"It's your favorite sister."
p56727
aS'Jill?'

p56735
aS'Aw.'
p56736
aS'Hair Straightener?'
p56737
aS"I haven't seen you in like.. a year."
p56738
aS"Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed."
p56739
aS'Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.'
p56740
aS"I decorated Dad's office."
p56741
aS'Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.'
p56742
aa(lp56743

aS'Its a girl?'
p56749
aS'Hey Amy.'
p56750
aS'Oh Amy, you remember Ross.'
p56751
aS'Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy  she used to date.'
p56752
aS'That was me.'
p56753
aa(lp56754
S'No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had  this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.'
p56755
aS'Still me.'
p56756
aS"No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It  was your fat"
p56757
aS"Amy. I'm going to save  you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me."
p56758
aS'Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.  CAREFUL!'
p56759
aS"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute  this isn't the china we picked out.."
p56760
aS'I know, after you left the store, I chose different  ones.'
p56761
aS'Why?'
p56762
aS'well no offense honey, but your taste is a little  feminine for me.'
p56763
aS'Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?'
p56764
aa(lp56765
S'Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!'
p56766
aS'Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to  come over>'
p56767

p56768
aS'I.. I.. I need a good lie.'
p56769
aS'Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on  the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!'
p56770
aS"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't  at a work thing today."
p56771
aS'Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.'
p56772
aS'I do not.'
p56773
aS'Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin  was gone-who took it?'
p56774
aS'Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey  don\'t eat that-that\'s Phoebe\'s" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey  you stink at lying." What am I going to do?'
p56775
aa(lp56776
S"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good  lie. I'll help you practice it."
p56777
aS"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you."
p56778
aS'Sure, what.. what was the work thing?'
p56779
aS'Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>'
p56780
aS'"Pick up grandma at the airport"?'
p56781
aS'Oh.. man..'
p56782
aS"Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to  get your real nose?"
p56783
aS"Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs  Ross' hand for support>"
p56784
aS'Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can  I take this upstairs?'
p56785
aS"Sure, we don't live there but..."
p56786
aa(lp56787
S"Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands  around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were  a doctor."
p56788
aS'Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.'
p56789
aS"Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>"
p56790
aS'God she is unbelievable.'
p56791
aS'I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.'
p56792
aS'Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.'
p56793
aS'Stupid Thanksgiving.'
p56794
aS'What? What happened?'
p56795
aS'My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find  a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then  his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married  guys.'
p56796
aS"Don't say that."
p56797
aa(lp56798
S'Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to  be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.'
p56799
aS"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk  to you in private?"
p56800
aS'Sure, you want to go upstairs?'
p56801
aS'Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.'
p56802
aS"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."
p56803
aS"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I  would like them to bond."
p56804
aS"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job."
p56805
aS"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just  going to have to make our peace with that!"
p56806
aS'Hi.'
p56807
aS'Hi, hey.'
p56808
aa(lp56809
S'Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.'
p56810
aS'Hi.'
p56811
aS"Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives."
p56812
aS'Yeah.'
p56813
aS'wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.'
p56814
aS'Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.'
p56815
aS'Hi.'
p56816
aS'Hi.'
p56817
aS'Hey you.'
p56818
aS"So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're  seeing Emma?"
p56819
aa(lp56820
S"Yeah I.. I think so. <sticks her hand out  to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her> It's nice to meet you Emma."
p56821
aS'Phoe-Be.'
p56822
aS"Oh. That's a funny noise."
p56823
aS'Pheebs, I still need some help here'
p56824
aS"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when  you're talking, people know you're lying."
p56825
aS"Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor."
p56826
aS'You are a terrific actor.'
p56827
aS"Hey. Hey where's the baby?"
p56828
aS'Oh we just put her down for a nap.'
p56829
aS'Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?  If you guys died.'
p56830
aa(lp56831
S'Thank you  Amy.'
p56832
aS"no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it  would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,  then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then  I'd get married."
p56833
aS'Thats a great movie. <she claps>'
p56834
aS"Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything  cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just  not really a big fan of Emily."
p56835
aS'Emma.'
p56836
aS'Emma, Ross wants you.'
p56837
aS'PHOE-BE.'
p56838
aS'Why does she keep making that  noise?'
p56839
aS"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby."
p56840
aS'Well who would?'
p56841
aa(lp56842
S"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would  want Monica and Chandler."
p56843
aS"I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma."
p56844
aS"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
p56845
aS"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die  and I don't get your baby?"
p56846
aS"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected  to the baby."
p56847
aS"Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump."
p56848
aS"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts  to cry>"
p56849
aS'<points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?'
p56850
aS"Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful."
p56851
aS'Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the  plate and more seriously> Woah.'
p56852
aa(lp56853
S"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>"
p56854
aS"Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?"
p56855
aS'No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.'
p56856
aS"I can't believe I won."
p56857
aS"Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you  would give your baby to these strangers over me."
p56858
aS"Monica is Ross' sister."
p56859
aS"No, Ross' sister was really fat."
p56860
aS'That was me.'
p56861
aS'No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.'
p56862
aS"Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that."
p56863
aa(lp56864
S"Okay, listen I know you're having a little  bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I  mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this."
p56865
aS'Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets  face it you have fun.'
p56866
aS'Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate  lady dies, then do I get the baby?'
p56867
aS'No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?'
p56868
aS'Well actually...'
p56869
aS'Actually what?'
p56870
aS'well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma  would go to my parents.'
p56871
aS'What?'
p56872
aS"Hurts, doesn't it?"
p56873
aS'Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?'
p56874
aa(lp56875
S"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough  to raise Emma?"
p56876
aS"No, that that is not what we're saying."
p56877
aS"Yeah he's lying. He looked down."
p56878
aS'Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!'
p56879
aS"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent."
p56880
aS"Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict."
p56881
aS'Thats not how you see me, is it?'
p56882
aS"No you're all about the fun."
p56883
aS"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do  you really think I'm not capable?"
p56884
aS"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're  strongest when.. when you're together."
p56885
aa(lp56886
S"Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks  on table> she'd have to give her up."
p56887
aS'Sure, Monica would have to give her up.'
p56888
aS'I lie better then that, right?'
p56889
aS'So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left  in my life gets taken away from me?'
p56890
aS"There's your movie! <claps>"
p56891
aS'Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.'
p56892
aS'Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise  poorly?'
p56893
aS"Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of  Merlot and a five year old condom."
p56894
aS"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong  father figure and I never will be."
p56895
aS'No you learn these things. You grow into it.'
p56896
aa(lp56897
S'Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody  knows it.'
p56898
aS"I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard  parts."
p56899
aS'Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go  to your room! You\'re grounded"?'
p56900
aS'Can you hear me say "You\'re grounded"?'
p56901
aS'You said that to me last week.'
p56902
aS'How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.'
p56903
aS"The producer from Days left a message  on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed  off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!"
p56904
aS"It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the  parade because you had a family emergency."
p56905
aS"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because  I had a family emergency."
p56906
aS'Ooh, what happened?'
p56907
aa(lp56908
S"Oh.. My sister's  raccoon."
p56909
aS'No! Nothing with a raccoon.'
p56910
aS"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands  out in the air>"
p56911
aS'Oh wait.. What are you doing?'
p56912
aS'Setting the table.'
p56913
aS'Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy  china for dessert too.'
p56914
aS'Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses  on my wedding dress.'
p56915
aS'Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.'
p56916
aS"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey."
p56917
aS"Ucch. <pauses> Uchh <louder  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."
p56918
aa(lp56919
S"UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>"
p56920
aS'You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.'
p56921
aS"Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when  I died and didn't give you my baby?"
p56922
aS'This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.'
p56923
aS'What? What carrer?'
p56924
aS"Um.. I'm a decorator."
p56925
aS"Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear."
p56926
aS"Why can't you ever be supportive?"
p56927
aS"Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby."
p56928
aS"Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in  the hospital when I was getting my lips done."
p56929
aa(lp56930
S"I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving  Emily to you."
p56931
aS'Emma.'
p56932
aS"Oh whose side are you on? <back  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle  the responibility of a child."
p56933
aS'How hard could it be? You do it.'
p56934
aS'ooh oooh..'
p56935
aS"Do you want to know why you don't want me to have  the baby?"
p56936
aS'uh huh.'
p56937
aS"Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have  always been jealous of me."
p56938
aS"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?"
p56939
aS"Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do  you even realize how much that hurt me?"
p56940
aa(lp56941
S'Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!'
p56942
aS'Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.'
p56943
aS'I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here  today.'
p56944
aS'Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.'
p56945
aS"ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's  forty five."
p56946
aS"You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.  Your baby isn't even that cute."
p56947
aS'Too far, Amy. Too far.'
p56948
aS'You take that back.'
p56949
aS'No.'
p56950
aS'Take it back!'
p56951
aa(lp56952
S'No! What are you going to do? Make me?'
p56953
aS'Heey man, I work out.'
p56954
aS'So do I.'
p56955
aS'I do pilates.'
p56956
aS'I do yoga.'
p56957
aS'Bring it on!'
p56958
aS'Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the  boxes!'
p56959
aS'Did you just push me?'
p56960
aS'Uh, yeah I think I did.'
p56961
aS'Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>'
p56962
aa(lp56963
S"Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't  time!"
p56964
aS'Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!'
p56965
aS"Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?"
p56966
aS'What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello  on them.'
p56967
aS'Ew! Gross.'
p56968
aS"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize  to her right now."
p56969
aS"I'm sorry."
p56970
aS"Mon, I'm so sorry."
p56971
aS'Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize  to each other and mean it.'
p56972
aS'Sorry.'
p56973
aa(lp56974
S'By the way, that fight was totally arousing.'
p56975
aS'Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.'
p56976
aS'Oh yeah? Well thanks.'
p56977
aS'So, so now do I get Joey?'
p56978
aS'Okay, but you should know he eats five times a  day and shoves pennies up his nose.'
p56979
aS'Are you okay Mon?'
p56980
aS"uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a  plate. Its not like somebody died."
p56981
aS"It's all right. You can mourn."
p56982
aS"Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks  towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies."
p56983
aS'Actually its not pies, its just pie.'
p56984
aa(lp56985
S"I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my  god. I've lost the will to scold."
p56986
aS"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.."
p56987
aS"So you're going to give me the baby?"
p56988
aS'Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren  discount.'
p56989
aS'You are not going to regret this.'
p56990
aS'She needs changing.'
p56991
aS"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
p56992
aS'Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?'
p56993
aS'Nope...'
p56994
aS'Broke them all, huh?'
p56995
aa(lp56996
S'Yep...'
p56997
aS'You gonna tell her?'
p56998
aS"Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna...  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should  use these plates again for a looong time."
p56999
aS'Like only if the queen comes?'
p57000
aS'Maybe not even then.'
p57001
aS'Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie  Pheebs.'
p57002
aS'No problem! Next week: stealing...'
p57003
aS'Bye plates!'
p57004
aS'Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?'
p57005
aS'What? Something happened with the plates?'
p57006
aa(lp57007
S'Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came  in...'
p57008
aS'This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy   in the cat condo is Jinkies.'
p57009
aS"Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?"
p57010
aS'Chandler Bing.'
p57011
aS"Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?"
p57012
aS"What's up Joe?"
p57013
aS'Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?'
p57014
aS"Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?"
p57015
aS'No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to   be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!'
p57016
aS'Courtside? Oh my God.'
p57017
aa(lp57018
S'Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with   his knee.'
p57019
aS"That's so cool. I'll let Monica know."
p57020
aS'Hello?'
p57021
aS"Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and   me tomorrow night."
p57022
aS"Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.   If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week."
p57023
aS"But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right   in fr. . .  That's not the way to convince you."
p57024
aS'Chandler look, I don\'t want to be one of those wives who says, "You   can\'t go to the game. You have to spend time with me." So, if you could just   realize it on your own . . .'
p57025
aS"I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to   figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this."
p57026
aS"Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him   that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that   what little time we have is precious."
p57027
aS"Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something."
p57028
aa(lp57029
S"Wow!  Wow, You look . . . uh . . .\xc2\xa0 It's just, ah . . .\xc2\xa0 That   dress . . . uh . . ."
p57030
aS'Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.'
p57031
aS"Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like   this. You, you clean up good."
p57032
aS'Oh well, well thank you.  Okay,   stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened,  that happened.'
p57033
aS'Oh right, right.  So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night   away from Emma?'
p57034
aS'Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank   you for watching the baby, by the way.'
p57035
aS"Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over."
p57036
aS"Phoebe's Mike?"
p57037
aS'Yeah.'
p57038
aS"I didn't know you guys hung out."
p57039
aa(lp57040
S"We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know,   maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
p57041
aS"Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be   awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?"
p57042
aS"I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.   He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some   experience in that area."
p57043
aS'Yeah.'
p57044
aS'Hi'
p57045
aS'Hey.'
p57046
aS"Oooh. Girl's night out indeed."
p57047
aS'Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,   but if you need anything Ross . . .'
p57048
aS"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun."
p57049
aS'Okay. You too. And I hope you score.  Bye.'
p57050
aa(lp57051
S'Bye.'
p57052
aS'So . . . Welcome.'
p57053
aS'I got beer.'
p57054
aS'I got bottled breast milk.'
p57055
aS"Eh, why don't we start with the beer?"
p57056
aS'Okay.  So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.'
p57057
aS'Yeah.'
p57058
aS'You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.'
p57059
aS'Ah?  Do you have one here?'
p57060
aS'No.'
p57061
aa(lp57062
S'Okay.'
p57063
aS"Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe   said you . . . You've been divorced?"
p57064
aS"Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to   talk about it."
p57065
aS"That's okay. We'll talk about  something else."
p57066
aS"So, you're a paleontologist, right?"
p57067
aS'Yeah.'
p57068
aS"My cousin's a paleontologist."
p57069
aS'Ah?  Well, he and I would probably have   a lot to talk about.'
p57070
aS'Hi.'
p57071
aS'Hey.'
p57072
aa(lp57073
S'Welcome home.'
p57074
aS'Oh well, look at you.'
p57075
aS'Yeah. What do you think?'
p57076
aS"Well, it looks great. It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the   same thing underneath. So . . ."
p57077
aS'Oh.'
p57078
aS'See what I mean . . .'
p57079
aS"Hey! How come the door's locked?"
p57080
aS'Just a second.'
p57081
aS"No, no, no, no, no. Joey can't know that I'm here."
p57082
aS'Why not?'
p57083
aa(lp57084
S"Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks   game. So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa."
p57085
aS'So, you lied to him?'
p57086
aS"Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.    Except with you."
p57087
aS"Hey! Open the door. What's going on?"
p57088
aS'What are you . ..  Why are you dressed   like that?'
p57089
aS"Oh, because, um . . . well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple   of days. So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction."
p57090
aS"Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before."
p57091
aS'Oh I was just doing Chandler\'s side of the conversation. You know,   like, "Hi, How do I look?"  "Really sexy. Could I BE any more   turned on?"'
p57092
aS'Okay.    Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out?'
p57093
aS'Because. . . one of them is for you.'
p57094
aa(lp57095
S'Cheers.  Okay, buh-bye.'
p57096
aS"You know, it's funny. I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction   myself.  Hi ya."
p57097
aS'You might want to keep practicing.'
p57098
aS'Yah.'
p57099
aS"It's Joey.  Hey Joe."
p57100
aS'Dude, come home!'
p57101
aS'What? Why?'
p57102
aS'COME . . . HOME.'
p57103
aS"Look I, I can't. What's going on?"
p57104
aS"I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin'   on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you."
p57105
aa(lp57106
S"All right look.  If you can't come home and   deal with this, then I'm gonna."
p57107
aS'NO!'
p57108
aS'I just heard him!'
p57109
aS'Can you . . . hear him . . . now?'
p57110
aS"No.  All right, I'm going in."
p57111
aS'No! Wait!'
p57112
aS'I heard him again!'
p57113
aS"All right, look. Just stay there. I'm   coming home."
p57114
aS"Okay. Great. I'll see you when you get here. I'm gonna wait out in   the hall in case the dude comes out."
p57115
aS'Is that really necessary?'
p57116
aa(lp57117
S"Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I   know how to keep my women satisfied."
p57118
aS"Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes   or less. Well, how long has it been?"
p57119
aS'Eleven minutes.  And now twelve.   So, do you like the beer?'
p57120
aS"I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager."
p57121
aS"huh.  What's the difference between beer and lager?"
p57122
aS"I don't know. We could look it up."
p57123
aS'Things are about to get wild.'
p57124
aS"Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around   talking about you and Ross?"
p57125
aS'Oh God. It seems like forever ago.'
p57126
aS"I know. \xc2\xa0 So, what's going on with you and Ross?"
p57127
aa(lp57128
S"Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But   you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah   . . . little thing."
p57129
aS'Oh my God! I love things. What happened?'
p57130
aS'Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we   had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.'
p57131
aS'Eye-contact?'
p57132
aS'Mm-hmm.'
p57133
aS'I hope you were using protection.'
p57134
aS'Excuse me. Um, these are from the two   gentlemen at the end of the bar.'
p57135
aS'Oh.  Should we send them something back?'
p57136
aS"Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes."
p57137
aS"No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think   they can come over here."
p57138
aa(lp57139
S'So? What if they do?'
p57140
aS"Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a   b. . . baby and a Ross."
p57141
aS'Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We\'re just having fun.   You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."'
p57142
aS"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa."
p57143
aS"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating   on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?  I heard it."
p57144
aS"I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair."
p57145
aS"All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape."
p57146
aS'Yes, because all good plans start with, "I\'ll go down the fire escape."'
p57147
aS"Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait   for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got   back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy   in here."
p57148
aS"Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?    I heard it."
p57149
aa(lp57150
S"I'm just going to wait for a little while."
p57151
aS"Scary pigeon's back?"
p57152
aS"It's huge."
p57153
aS"Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother   lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells   like chicken? Looks like a potato."
p57154
aS'"Spuds" is your grandmother?'
p57155
aS"That's my bubby!"
p57156
aS"So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um. . . maybe we can get   your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun."
p57157
aS"Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen   with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend."
p57158
aS"All right. It's no big deal."
p57159
aS'So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?'
p57160
aa(lp57161
S"Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But   um. . ."
p57162
aS'Then, can I have your number?'
p57163
aS"I'm sorry, no."
p57164
aS'Okay.'
p57165
aS'Oh sure.'
p57166
aS"Oh my God, you're giving your real number."
p57167
aS"Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight."
p57168
aS'Great.'
p57169
aS'Bye'
p57170
aS"Bye.  Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma   are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?"
p57171
aa(lp57172
S"I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse."
p57173
aS"What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to   Ross about it?"
p57174
aS'No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation\'s gonna go. "Hey   Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."'
p57175
aS'"Yeah."  "Me too."'
p57176
aS'"Well, but I\'m not sure I really want to do anything about   it."'
p57177
aS'"Yeah."  "Me neither."'
p57178
aS'"Well, should we just continue to live together and not   really tell each other how we\'re really feeling?"'
p57179
aS'"Yeah. That works for me."'
p57180
aS'Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.'
p57181
aS'Oh, thanks.'
p57182
aa(lp57183
S"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough."
p57184
aS'Wha. . . hey!'
p57185
aS'Better!'
p57186
aS'Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments   with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.'
p57187
aS"Really? You're moving on from Ross?"
p57188
aS"I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?"
p57189
aS"Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight.   Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message."
p57190
aS"Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get   my number back.  Oh my God.   He's gone."
p57191
aS'"Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God.   He\'s gone."  Dead on.'
p57192
aS"Ya know, I'm going to take off."
p57193
aa(lp57194
S'So soon?'
p57195
aS'Well, yeah.'
p57196
aS'Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.'
p57197
aS'Ah, you mean lager.'
p57198
aS'Ah yeah. Good times.'
p57199
aS'Oh.'
p57200
aS'Hello?'
p57201
aS"Hey, Mike, it's me. Listen,   is um, is Ross near you?"
p57202
aS'Uh, no. I just left.'
p57203
aS'Well, you have to go back in.'
p57204
aa(lp57205
S'Wha . . .? Go back? To the "land where time stands still"?'
p57206
aS"I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,   um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all   his calls."
p57207
aS"I can't do that!"
p57208
aS"He says he can't do that."
p57209
aS"Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike? Hi.   Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I .   . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want. Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff."
p57210
aS"All right.  Hello? Hi. I'm sorry   about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff."
p57211
aS"All right. I'll do it.    But really, how much dirtier can it get?"
p57212
aS'Oh, Mike. Bye.'
p57213
aS'Hey buddy.'
p57214
aS'Uh, hi.'
p57215
aa(lp57216
S'Um, can I come back in?'
p57217
aS'Why?'
p57218
aS'I, I was just thinking about how much more we   have to talk about.'
p57219
aS'But you left.'
p57220
aS"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three   hour flight."
p57221
aS"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
p57222
aS"Chandler! You're home!"
p57223
aS"That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop."
p57224
aS'What are you saying?'
p57225
aS"Joey said that you're in here with another man."
p57226
aa(lp57227
S"There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that."
p57228
aS"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend   take a look around, huh?  Bwa-ah-ah!"
p57229
aS'What is he doing?'
p57230
aS'I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.'
p57231
aS'Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.'
p57232
aS"All right. Well, I'll check the guest room."
p57233
aS"Why do I smell men's cologne?"
p57234
aS"I think that's you."
p57235
aS'Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.'
p57236
aS"There's nobody here Joe."
p57237
aa(lp57238
S'I guess not.'
p57239
aS"I can't believe you thought I was cheating.  You   own me an apology."
p57240
aS"Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry."
p57241
aS"Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could   happen to anyone. All right, see ya."
p57242
aS'Whoa,   whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how   did your suitcase beat you here?'
p57243
aS"I climb down the fire escape and you   can't put that in the closet?"
p57244
aS"So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the   same thing. Fascinating isn't it."
p57245
aS'Maybe you should look up "fascinating."'
p57246
aS"I'll get it.  Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking.    It's for you."
p57247
aS"I don't understand what just happened   here."
p57248
aa(lp57249
S"What's going on?"
p57250
aS"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend   the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand."
p57251
aS'What? You think I\'m too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be   with his wife? Huh? Do you think I\'m like, "Duh."'
p57252
aS'Joey?'
p57253
aS'Yeah?'
p57254
aS"I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you."
p57255
aS'Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to   you?'
p57256
aS"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know   you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a   bump on the head."
p57257
aS"I'm sorry. \xc2\xa0That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with   Monica."
p57258
aS'All right.'
p57259
aa(lp57260
S'You can go.'
p57261
aS'What?'
p57262
aS"You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to."
p57263
aS"Really? You're gonna be okay?"
p57264
aS"Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the   art of seduction."
p57265
aS"You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
p57266
aS"It's gonna be so hot!"
p57267
aS'Okay, bye.'
p57268
aS'Have fun.'
p57269
aS"Thanks.  Here's your ticket."
p57270
aa(lp57271
S"Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want   you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid."
p57272
aS'Thanks man.'
p57273
aS'Where are you going?'
p57274
aS"Game's tomorrow night Joe."
p57275
aS'Hi.'
p57276
aS'Oh God.'
p57277
aS'Oh . . .'
p57278
aS"I'm so glad you're back."
p57279
aS'Oh.'
p57280
aS'Wow. So, what did you guys do?'
p57281
aa(lp57282
S'Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries   of normal social conduct.'
p57283
aS"It's true. I did."
p57284
aS'Well, good bye.'
p57285
aS'That was fun Pheebs.'
p57286
aS'I know. That was fun.'
p57287
aS'See you guys.'
p57288
aS'Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.'
p57289
aS'Oh shoot. I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.  Wait, wait. Sorry. Did he call?   Did that guy call?'
p57290
aS'No. Just his mom.'
p57291
aS'Oh, around 8:30?'
p57292
aa(lp57293
S'Yeah.'
p57294
aS'Then, again at 9:00?'
p57295
aS'uh-huh.'
p57296
aS'Yeah.'
p57297
aS'Hello.  Ah, no, she\'s not here right now. Can I take a message?    Bill from the bar?  Okay, "Bill from the bar."   I\'ll make sure she gets your number.'
p57298
aS'Aaah.'
p57299
aS'So, ah . . . So, how was it?\xc2\xa0 Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have   a good time?'
p57300
aS'Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out.'
p57301
aS'Uh, Rach.'
p57302
aS'Yeah?'
p57303
aa(lp57304
S'Never   mind.'
p57305
aS'Hey you guys.'
p57306
aS'Hey.'
p57307
aS"Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom."
p57308
aS"Stout. That's a kind of beer."
p57309
aS'...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"'
p57310
aS'Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?'
p57311
aS'Uh-huh.'
p57312
aS"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
p57313
aS"I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas."
p57314
aa(lp57315
S"You're really not coming back?"
p57316
aS"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
p57317
aS"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
p57318
aS'So, who does?'
p57319
aS'Oh, I like my job.'
p57320
aS'I *love* my job.'
p57321
aS"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
p57322
aS"I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!"
p57323
aS"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
p57324
aS"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
p57325
aa(lp57326
S"Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day."
p57327
aS"You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??"
p57328
aS'Did I not mention that?'
p57329
aS'No!'
p57330
aS'AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!'
p57331
aS'All right everybody, I know that it\'s Christmas Eve and you\'d rather be with your families, but there\'s *no* call  for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.'
p57332
aS'Hey!'
p57333
aS'Hey.'
p57334
aS"Hey. Where've you been?"
p57335
aS"I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham."
p57336
aa(lp57337
S"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
p57338
aS"My kid's in a play right now."
p57339
aS"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
p57340
aS'"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".'
p57341
aS"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
p57342
aS'*Now* it feels like Christmas.'
p57343
aS"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
p57344
aS'You can come to my house!'
p57345
aS'Haha, no thanks!'
p57346
aS'That was a nice pep-talk.'
p57347
aa(lp57348
S"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
p57349
aS'So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?'
p57350
aS'Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...'
p57351
aS'So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.'
p57352
aS'Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.'
p57353
aS"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
p57354
aS"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
p57355
aS'We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.'
p57356
aS"What? That's terrible!"
p57357
aS'No-no, we do it every year!'
p57358
aa(lp57359
S'Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.'
p57360
aS"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
p57361
aS"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
p57362
aS"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
p57363
aS'Oh no, we have to!'
p57364
aS"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
p57365
aS'Well then, you should look with us.'
p57366
aS'Why?'
p57367
aS"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
p57368
aS'No, I have a great idea for a present for her.'
p57369
aa(lp57370
S"Oh, that's it?  A great idea! Oh yeah."
p57371
aS"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
p57372
aS"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
p57373
aS"That's right!"
p57374
aS'Ooh ooh, we have a live one!'
p57375
aS"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
p57376
aS'Oh.'
p57377
aS"Ooh, who's it for?"
p57378
aS'"Dear losers, do you really think I\'d hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they\'d break you."'
p57379
aS'Rach, these are for you.'
p57380
aa(lp57381
S"Wiper blades. I don't even have a car."
p57382
aS"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
p57383
aS'OK, Pheebs, your turn.'
p57384
aS'Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?'
p57385
aS'Uh-huh.'
p57386
aS'You guuuyys.'
p57387
aS'And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.'
p57388
aS'You got me a cola drink?'
p57389
aS'And, a lemon lime.'
p57390
aS'Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.'
p57391
aa(lp57392
S'And last but not least.'
p57393
aS"They're ribbed for *your* pleasure."
p57394
aS'Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?'
p57395
aS'Cool!'
p57396
aS'Yeah!'
p57397
aS'Come on Ben.'
p57398
aS'Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...'
p57399
aS'Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!'
p57400
aS'Santa!'
p57401
aS'Hey!'
p57402
aa(lp57403
S'What are you doing here, Santa?'
p57404
aS"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
p57405
aS"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
p57406
aS'What?'
p57407
aS"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
p57408
aS'What are you doing?'
p57409
aS'You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!'
p57410
aS'Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.'
p57411
aS'Why?'
p57412
aS"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
p57413
aa(lp57414
S"But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
p57415
aS"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
p57416
aS"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
p57417
aS'Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?'
p57418
aS'Santa? Really?'
p57419
aS'Yeah, is that okay?'
p57420
aS'Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?'
p57421
aS'No.'
p57422
aS"Then it's okaaay!"
p57423
aS"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
p57424
aa(lp57425
S"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
p57426
aS"Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?"
p57427
aS"Naah... I couldn't leave you alone."
p57428
aS'Ah. Thanks.'
p57429
aS"Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham."
p57430
aS'Ah.  Chandler Bing.'
p57431
aS"Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas."
p57432

p57437
aS"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
p57438
aS"Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name."
p57439
aS'It is. Did I... not tell you about her?'
p57440
aS"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
p57441
aS'I sent them home.'
p57442
aS'Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?'
p57443
aS'Uhh, uh...'

aS'Answer faster, answer faster!'
p57445
aS"I don't know!"
p57446
aa(lp57447
S'Answer better, answer better!'
p57448
aS"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
p57449
aS'What does she do there?'
p57450
aS"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
p57451
aS'She did WHAT?'
p57452
aS'BE-LOW me!'
p57453
aS'Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?'
p57454
aS'*What*??'
p57455
aS"Well, she... she didn't win..."
p57456
aS'Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.'
p57457
aa(lp57458
S"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
p57459
aS'Oh Chandler, stop talking!'
p57460
aS"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
p57461
aS'Okay.'
p57462

aS'The wife says "Hi!".'
p57471
aS'Ah. Fun conversation?'
p57472
aS"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
p57473
aS"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?"
p57474
aS"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
p57475

p57476
aS'...Missy?'
p57477

p57484
aS"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
p57485
aS'Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?'

aS"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
p57487
aS'Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?'
p57488
aS'I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!'
p57489
aS'Really?'
p57490
aa(lp57491
S"You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
p57492
aS'Well, not anymore.'
p57493
aS"But we don't do that."
p57494
aS'I know, I just thought it would be fun.'
p57495
aS'How drunk are you?'
p57496
aS'Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.'
p57497
aS"That's the perfect amount!"
p57498
aS'Okay!'
p57499
aS"Y'know what's weird?"

p57507
aS'Okay!'
p57508
aS'Wow! You are really fast!'
p57509

aS'Yep!'

aS'Two!'
p57517
aS'Two!'
p57518
aS'Three!'
p57519
aS"Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined."
p57520
aS"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
p57521
aS'Eh!'
p57522
aS'So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?'
p57523
aa(lp57524
S'Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.'
p57525
aS"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
p57526
aS"I think you're better than you think you are."
p57527
aS'Really? Okay, so...'
p57528
aS'Know when to stop.'
p57529
aS"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
p57530
aS"Yeah.  Don't do the dance."
p57531
aS'Right!'
p57532
aS"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
p57533

p57536
aS"Let's go!"
p57537
aS'No-no-no, wait! We need something old!'
p57538
aS"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
p57539
aS"That'll work!"
p57540
aS"I don't think so."
p57541

p57545
aa(lp57546
S'Ohh.'
p57547
aS'Okay, one thing at a time.'
p57548
aS"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
p57549
aS'Ehh.'
p57550
aS'Eh, you work for that.'
p57551
aS"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
p57552
aS'You do?!'
p57553
aS"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
p57554
aS"Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
p57555
aS"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
p57556
aa(lp57557
S'You thought about that?'
p57558
aS'Yeah.'
p57559
aS'How many kids were we gonna have?'
p57560
aS'Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.'
p57561
aS'What else did you think about?'
p57562
aS"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
p57563
aS"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
p57564
aS'Sure you do.'
p57565
aS'No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.'

p57593
aS'What?'
p57594
aS'What, you, you really quit your job?'
p57595
aS"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
p57596
aS'What do you really want to do?'
p57597
aS'I have *not* thought this through!'

aS"Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this."
p57611
aa(lp57612
S'I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.'

p57614
aS"I don't have a *job*!"
p57615
aS"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...   Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!"

p57617
aS'Hey!'
p57618
aS"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant."
p57619
aS"I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life."
p57620
aS'Well, I just lost my erection.'
p57621
aS'I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?'
p57622
aa(lp57623
S"You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting."
p57624
aS"But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start."
p57625
aS'Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!'
p57626
aS'Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!'
p57627
aS'I know!!! My erection is back!'
p57628
aS'Thank you!'
p57629
aS'Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?'
p57630
aS'Okay.'
p57631
aS': Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?'
p57632
aS"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash."
p57633
aa(lp57634
S'If you want I could loan you some money?'
p57635
aS"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
p57636
aS'Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?'
p57637
aS'You could do that?'
p57638
aS'Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.'
p57639
aS"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!"
p57640
aS"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
p57641

aa(lp57645
S''
aS'Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?'
p57646
aS"Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?"
p57647
aS'She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?'
p57648
aS'Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I\'m gonna whip them with a car antenna!'
p57649
aS"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.Can I get a blue bow?"
p57650
aS'Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.'
p57651
aS'How long was I in there?'
p57652
aS"Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising."
p57653
aS"Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!"
p57654
aa(lp57655
S"Don't you want to look through the rest?"
p57656
aS"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
p57657
aS'You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!'
p57658
aS'I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It\'s milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"'
p57659
aS'I got one. "Socks. Because your family\'s feet deserve the best."'
p57660
aS'Honey? Leave it to the pros.'
p57661
aS'I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.'
p57662
aS'"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."'
p57663
aS'"Marriage. It\'s not for everybody."'
p57664
aS'That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.'
p57665
aa(lp57666
S'Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.'
p57667
aS"I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?"
p57668
aS'Who the hell are you?'
p57669
aS"I'm the hell person whose office this is!"
p57670
aS'Good one, Rach.'
p57671
aS"I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job."
p57672
aS'Excuse me?'
p57673
aS"Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?"
p57674
aS"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!"
p57675
aS"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?"
p57676
aa(lp57677
S"Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous."
p57678
aS"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back."
p57679
aS'Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. You\'re gonna take this tray, you\'re gonna stay on this yellow mark. You\'re gonna move on "action!" You\'re gonna walk over to the operating table. You\'re gonna stop on that blue mark, you\'re gonna putthe tray down. Don\'t walk too fast! But don\'t doddle.'
p57680
aS'Okay, now. What?'
p57681
aS'And...Action!!'
p57682
aS'Cut! Cut!'
p57683
aS"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous."
p57684

p57685
aS'Okay, that helps.'
p57686
aS'And...Action!'
p57687
aa(lp57688
S'Cut!'
p57689
aS"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright, eight."
p57690
aS'And...Action!'
p57691
aS'So, do you have any other question about advertising?'
p57692
aS'No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."'
p57693
aS'Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.'
p57694
aS"Really? That's great!"
p57695
aS"It's an unpaid internship."
p57696
aS'It\'s funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."'
p57697
aS"Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support."
p57698
aa(lp57699
S"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now."
p57700
aS'Stop!'
p57701
aS'Okay.'
p57702
aS"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
p57703
aS'Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.'
p57704
aS'A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.'
p57705
aS"Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island."
p57706
aS"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office."
p57707
aS"I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you."
p57708
aS'Excuse me?'

S'Rach we have a code brown situation.'

aS'Can you please, please take care of it for me?'
p57712
aS'Alright, but you have to do one sometime.'
p57713
aS'Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?'
p57714
aS'Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.'
p57715
aS"That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp."
p57716
aS"I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department."
p57717
aS'Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?'
p57718
aS"Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit."
p57719
aS"Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?"
p57720
aa(lp57721
S'Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.'
p57722
aS'Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.'
p57723
aS"Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!"
p57724
aS"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
p57725
aS"Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision."
p57726
aS'Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.'
p57727
aS'Incidentally, when are you coming back?'
p57728
aS'Today.'
p57729
aS'You said two weeks.'
p57730
aS'No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.'
p57731
aa(lp57732
S'Hey.'
p57733
aS'Hey. So, what did he say?'
p57734
aS'Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I\'m gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn\'t get her puppy act together, I\'m gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."'
p57735
aS"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor."
p57736
aS"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray."
p57737
aS'Joey.'
p57738
aS"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and shecarries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
p57739
aS'Who dies?'
p57740
aS'Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.'
p57741
aS'Yes, doctor.'
p57742
aa(lp57743
S'Okay.'
p57744
aS"Okay, let's try this one more time."
p57745
aS'Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!'
p57746
aS'And...Action!'
p57747
aS"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?"
p57748
aS'The rest of the scene.'
p57749
aS'Okay, from the top, people!'
p57750
aS"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
p57751
aS"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
p57752
aS"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right nowthis guy's gonna try to squeeze me out."
p57753
aa(lp57754
S"What about Emma? We don't have a nanny."
p57755
aS"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?"
p57756
aS"Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way."
p57757
aS"Come on, I don't know what else to do."
p57758
aS"Fine, fine.  We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will."
p57759
aS'Ross?'
p57760
aS'Huh?'
p57761
aS"You're pretty."
p57762
aS"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
p57763
aS"So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?"
p57764
aa(lp57765
S'Yeah.'
p57766
aS'Good-bye.'
p57767
aS"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing.  Didn't see you there Geller."
p57768
aS'Yeah, Ross is here so...'
p57769
aS'Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?'
p57770
aS"We're gonna have sex."
p57771
aS"I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something."
p57772
aS"Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not."
p57773
aS'Pants off Bing!'
p57774
aS"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
p57775
aa(lp57776
S"Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync."
p57777
aS'Hey, they were popular when I left!'
p57778
aS"Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow."
p57779
aS"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
p57780
aS"That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?"
p57781
aS"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!"
p57782
aS'Fine.'
p57783
aS"Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?"
p57784
aS"Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out."
p57785
aS'Fine, I will.  Alright, fill me in!'
p57786
aa(lp57787
S'Hey.'
p57788
aS'Hey.'
p57789
aS'You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.'
p57790
aS"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
p57791
aS"Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees."
p57792
aS"Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!"
p57793
aS'Sorry.  But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.'
p57794
aS"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant."
p57795
aS'What are you talking about?'
p57796
aS'That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.'
p57797
aa(lp57798
S'What!? You faked it?'
p57799
aS"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual"
p57800
aS"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
p57801
aS"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay."
p57802
aS"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress?That's gonna confuse my fans."
p57803
aS'Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.'
p57804
aS"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
p57805
aS'Nice.'
p57806
aS"Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?"
p57807
aS'No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.'
p57808
aa(lp57809
S'About what?'
p57810
aS'He slept with you and then never called you.'
p57811
aS'And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.'
p57812
aS'Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!'
p57813
aS"So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me."
p57814
aS"I'm surprised to, but yet here I am."
p57815
aS'Cut, cut! What are you doing!?'
p57816
aS"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
p57817
aS'Me too!'
p57818
aS'Me too!'
p57819
aa(lp57820
S'Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!'
p57821
aS"Wow, you're here already."
p57822
aS"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, butI think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!"
p57823
aS'How do you fix the chair?'
p57824
aS"Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
p57825
aS"Good, because it's in ten minutes."
p57826
aS"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
p57827
aS"Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's goinghelicopter shopping."
p57828
aS"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
p57829
aS'You can do the presentation.'
p57830
aa(lp57831
S"No, I can't, I have a baby."
p57832
aS"I'll watch her."
p57833
aS'Why would you do that?'
p57834
aS"Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy."
p57835
aS"That's really nice."
p57836
aS'I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.'
p57837
aS"Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you."
p57838
aS"I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children.  Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you."
p57839
aS"Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her."
p57840
aS'Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.'
p57841
aa(lp57842
S"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
p57843
aS"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
p57844
aS"I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process."
p57845
aS"You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it."
p57846
aS"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
p57847
aS'What?'
p57848
aS"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focusfrom you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!"
p57849
aS"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
p57850
aS"You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!"
p57851
aS'Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.'
p57852
aa(lp57853
S"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
p57854
aS"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby,I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
p57855
aS'Like a month?'
p57856
aS'Or a year?'
p57857
aS'Really, you want to wait a year?'
p57858
aS'It could be less than a year. I mean, you\'ve heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It\'ll probably be more than a year.'
p57859
aS'I really wanna have a baby.'
p57860
aS"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back."
p57861
aS'No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.'
p57862
aS'I quit and you learn what I do?'
p57863
aa(lp57864
S"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons."
p57865
aS"I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby."
p57866
aS"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!"
p57867
aS'Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?'
p57868
aS'Yes, please!'
p57869
aS'Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.'
p57870
aS"I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!"
p57871
aS"I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother."
p57872
aS"I'm not your brother."
p57873
aS'What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!'
p57874
aa(lp57875
S'Hey'
p57876
aS"Hey. So where's Mon?"
p57877
aS"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
p57878
aS"And you're not helping?"
p57879
aS'I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice   - not helping.'
p57880
aS'Hey you guys!'
p57881
aS'Hey! Happy birthday ...'
p57882
aS"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
p57883
aS'Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.'
p57884
aS'Hi.'
p57885
aa(lp57886
S'Hi.'
p57887
aS"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
p57888
aS"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
p57889
aS"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
p57890
aS"No, you stay, I'll do it ."
p57891
aS'OK, thank you.'
p57892
aS'Nice to meet you guys .'
p57893
aS'Yeah, you too.'
p57894
aS'Oh, wow, Molly is just great!'
p57895
aS'Yeah.'
p57896
aa(lp57897
S'Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.'
p57898
aS"What? You really think she's hot?"
p57899
aS"Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now."
p57900
aS'And Joey?'
p57901
aS"How do you think she's doing?"
p57902
aS"Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?"
p57903
aS"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
p57904
aS'Thank you!'
p57905
aS"Now that Rachel's gone?"
p57906
aS'So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.'
p57907
aa(lp57908
S"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
p57909
aS'Lima.'
p57910
aS'No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully   with a "to" in the middle.'
p57911
aS'You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".    Oh god! Oh!'
p57912
aS'What?'
p57913
aS"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a   rat in your cupboard."
p57914
aS"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
p57915
aS'What, is he your pet rat?'
p57916
aS"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who   I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on   the plate of cookies."
p57917
aS"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary,   and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."
p57918
aa(lp57919
S'What are those?'
p57920
aS"I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get   rid of it!"
p57921
aS"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
p57922
aS'Thank you.'
p57923
aS"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers."
p57924
aS'Hello.'
p57925
aS'Hello'
p57926
aS'Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma   yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.'
p57927
aS'For what?'
p57928
aS'Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous   and arrogant and obnoxious ...'
p57929
aa(lp57930
S'Is this your first appology?'
p57931
aS"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And   I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you."
p57932
aS'Good morning!'
p57933
aS"Hello.  But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished."
p57934
aS'What?'
p57935
aS'I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!'
p57936
aS"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her   skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area."
p57937
aS"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
p57938
aS'Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?'
p57939
aS'Oh yeah, I\'m jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at   my ass".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just   think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she\'s your   subordinate.'
p57940
aa(lp57941
S'I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.'
p57942
aS"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship."
p57943
aS"Huh. What's Tag's last name?"
p57944
aS'It was ...  oh my god. He didn\'t have a last   name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.'
p57945
aS'But it was a deap meaningful relationship.'
p57946
aS"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!"
p57947
aS'It was Jones.'
p57948
aS'Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?'
p57949
aS'Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.'
p57950
aS'You mean, when you were a baby.'
p57951
aa(lp57952
S'Sure.'
p57953
aS'Would you stop staring at her?'
p57954
aS"I wasn't staring. I was leering."
p57955
aS"What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind   of way."
p57956
aS"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it."
p57957
aS'Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.'
p57958
aS'Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl   for once.'
p57959
aS"I'm gonna take her back to the appartment."
p57960
aS"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you   - wovyou dovyou ..."
p57961
aS'Bye'
p57962
aa(lp57963
S"They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good."
p57964
aS"I think it's sweet."
p57965
aS'Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.'
p57966
aS"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her."
p57967
aS'Why not?'
p57968
aS"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything   to, you know, drive her away."
p57969
aS"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds   about right."
p57970
aS"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
p57971
aS"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
p57972
aS'What are you, a child?'
p57973
aa(lp57974
S'Yes!'
p57975
aS'Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy   on someone else.'
p57976
aS'Fine.'
p57977
aS'Take me home!'
p57978
aS'Hey Mikey'
p57979
aS'Hey P'
p57980
aS'What are you doing?'
p57981
aS'Setting rat traps.'
p57982
aS'To kill Bob??'
p57983
aS'No, no, to test his neck strength.'
p57984
aa(lp57985
S"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna   capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can   maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
p57986
aS"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."
p57987
aS"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!   Bob's a mom!"
p57988
aS'Better think of a new name for him.'
p57989
aS"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
p57990
aS"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ..."
p57991
aS'Oh my god, we killed Bob!'
p57992
aS"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
p57993
aS'Suzie?'
p57994
aS'Whazzup??'
p57995
aa(lp57996
S'Seriously dude, 3 years ago.'
p57997
aS"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep   an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
p57998
aS"You don't trust him?"
p57999
aS'Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked   for her daughter, the "hot nanny".'
p58000
aS'Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now.'
p58001
aS"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?"
p58002
aS"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know   as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it."
p58003
aS"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees."
p58004
aS'Picturing that tree?'
p58005
aS'I am, yes.'
p58006
aa(lp58007

p58008
aS'For a walk.'
p58009
aS'Oh. You mind if I join you?'
p58010
aS'Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts.'
p58011
aS'Your thoughts? Plural?'
p58012
aS"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta   see her!"
p58013
aS"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
p58014
aS"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?"
p58015
aS"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
p58016
aS'Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the   world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.'
p58017
aa(lp58018
S'Great novels?'

p58022

p58023
aS'Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.'
p58024
aS"Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.   Yes?"
p58025
aS"If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?"
p58026
aS"Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your   pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you,   don't I?"
p58027
aS'Oh, please, I don\'t care about you enough to bug me. In fact,   from now on, I\'m going take the high road. And I\'m going be very very nice to   you, you "momma\'s boy", starting right now.'

p58033
aS'Pleased to meet you.'
p58034
aS"Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?"
p58035
aS"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his   mother."
p58036
aS"Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday."

p58042
aS'Right there! That was so fake!'
p58043
aS'Shh!'
p58044
aS"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the   last person I want to see."
p58045
aS"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time."
p58046
aS"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy   hates me."
p58047
aS'Does he?'
p58048
aS'What?'
p58049
aS"Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first   grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly   had a crush on me?"
p58050
aa(lp58051
S'Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet   to see if he can knock you over.'

aS"She's out, I'm gonna take her home."
p58053
aS'Oh, ok, thank you.   Do you see what all the guys   see in her?'
p58054
aS"Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!"
p58055
aS'Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?'
p58056
aS'Yeah, sure!'
p58057

p58064
aS'So this is what a stroke feels like.'
p58065
aS"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility   now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're   a mother."
p58066
aS'Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?'
p58067
aS'No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed   them.'
p58068
aS"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
p58069
aS"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone   can afford help."
p58070
aS'Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.'

p58076
aS'So where did you study?'
p58077
aS"Oh, I didn't go to college."
p58078
aS'No, where did you study acting?'

p58085
aS"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
p58086
aS"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.   What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?   Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,   and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this   way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
p58087
aS'Come on! Joe!'
p58088
aS'Ok'

p58096
aS'Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve   around their rats?'
p58097
aS"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
p58098
aS'Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate   and there are hundreds of them?'
p58099
aS"Mate? They're all brothers and sisters."
p58100
aS'Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they\'re more of a "love   the one you\'re with" kind of animals.'
p58101
aS"No.  wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what   are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then   each of those have 7 rats? That's like ...    That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
p58102
aS'Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let   the box of rats ruin our lives.'
p58103
aS"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.   But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's   favorites."

p58107
aS"No, I think you're sweet."
p58108
aS"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.   I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to   my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't   told you about that yet, have I?"
p58109
aS'Hey!'
p58110

p58122
aS"Look, I'll just give you this and go."
p58123
aS'Oh, you bought me a present! Why?'
p58124
aS'Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There   are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you   the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.'
p58125
aS'Aww. Well, ok, well that\'s very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"'

p58130
aS"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such   a hard time?"
p58131
aS"I'm not sure."
p58132
aS"Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me."
p58133
aS'I do have feelings for you.'
p58134
aS'You do?'
p58135
aS'Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.'
p58136
aS"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion   of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ..."

p58143
aS'No, but I like it. I think I left one of   my rat babies.'
p58144
aS"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
p58145

p58151
aS"OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?"
p58152
aS'No!'
p58153
aS'OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.'
p58154
aS'Our balcony? Seriously? That\'s so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It\'s too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"'
p58155
aS"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !"
p58156
aS'So are you gonna...talk to her?'
p58157
aS"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
p58158
aS'You know when "That\'s fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!'
p58159
aS"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!"
p58160
aa(lp58161
S"No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?"
p58162
aS'I don\'t know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.'
p58163
aS"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
p58164
aS'Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.'
p58165
aS'Why did I get married?!'
p58166
aS'Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?'
p58167
aS'Well it depends.'
p58168
aS'On...?'
p58169
aS"On how far along he's in the sex change process!"
p58170
aS"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are..."
p58171
aa(lp58172
S"Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!"
p58173
aS'Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...'
p58174
aS'Oh man! I have to get those done too?!'
p58175
aS'Wow! Talking about high maintenance'
p58176
aS'Hey hey! You dye your hair!'
p58177
aS"I'm a woman!"
p58178
aS'Arghhh! Double standards!'
p58179
aS"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?"
p58180
aS"Only if I don't have to get up and sing."
p58181
aS"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny."
p58182
aa(lp58183
S"It's just, I'm not good at singing."
p58184
aS"Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?"
p58185
aS"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!"
p58186
aS"OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing."
p58187
aS"So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?"
p58188
aS'While drinking...'
p58189
aS"I'm there!"
p58190
aS'Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.'
p58191
aS'Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there'
p58192
aS'No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.'
p58193
aa(lp58194
S'Oh my god.'
p58195
aS'You kissed him?'
p58196
aS'Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...'
p58197
aS'Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?'
p58198
aS'It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.'
p58199
aS'Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?'
p58200
aS'You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...'
p58201
aS'I thought you hated him?'
p58202
aS'You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!'
p58203
aS'So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?'
p58204
aa(lp58205
S"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes."
p58206
aS'Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross'
p58207
aS'Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...'
p58208
aS"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
p58209
aS'Hi'

p58217
aS'Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?'
p58218
aS'Oh absolutely.'
p58219
aS'Oh good...'
p58220
aS'Are you looking to meet somebody?'
p58221
aS"All right let's just do this."
p58222
aS"We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit..."
p58223
aS"Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!"
p58224
aS"Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?"
p58225
aS'Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.'
p58226
aa(lp58227
S"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself...."
p58228
aS"That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?"
p58229
aS'What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!'
p58230
aS"I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me"
p58231
aS"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
p58232
aS'No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.'
p58233
aS'Did she go out with him?'
p58234
aS'No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.'
p58235
aS'Ah! The high road...'
p58236
aS'You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!'
p58237
aa(lp58238
S'Are you trying to get everybody divorced?'
p58239
aS"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one..."
p58240
aS'I thought I had to make the jokes!'
p58241
aS"Don't you have to be at work?"
p58242
aS"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!"
p58243
aS'Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here\'s a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"'
p58244
aS'Sorry...we were just leaving'
p58245
aS'We still got it!'
p58246
aS'Who is it?'
p58247
aS'Gavin! I brought you some soup.'
p58248
aa(lp58249
S'Why?'
p58250
aS'I heard you were sick...'
p58251
aS"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin"
p58252
aS'I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?'
p58253
aS"I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick"
p58254
aS'Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.'
p58255
aS'Oh no no no'
p58256
aS'So I had fun last night'
p58257
aS'So did I'
p58258
aS'Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?'
p58259
aa(lp58260
S"It's just a cold"
p58261
aS'Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...'

aS"What? What's the matter?"
p58263
aS"What's Ross doing to you on that picture?"
p58264
aS"Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny."
p58265
aS"Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything"
p58266
aS"Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!"
p58267
aS'Yeah! But you said not to worry about...'

p58275
aS'What?'
p58276

aS'OK.'
p58281
aa(lp58282
S'So hum...Why did I have to hide?'

aS'So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...'
p58285
aS"There isn't. There is totally isn't."
p58286
aS'You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.'
p58287
aS"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place."
p58288
aS"It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?"
p58289
aS'Yes'
p58290
aS'I think you should talk to Ross about all this.'
p58291
aS"People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin"
p58292
aa(lp58293

p58317
aS'By drowning or...?!'
p58318
aS'Why would he break up with me?'
p58319
aS"I don't know sweetie."
p58320

p58321
aS'Well...'

aS'I know!'
p58323
aS'All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we\'ve got Monicasinging "Delta Dawn".'

p58365
aS"Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk.. somebody here?"
p58366
aS"Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle."
p58367

p58368
aS"Oh, just this woman I've been seeing."
p58369
aa(lp58370
S"You've being seeing someone?"
p58371
aS"Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice."
p58372
aS'What are you taking amoxicillin for?'
p58373
aS"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel."
p58374
aS"Hi, and I am also Emma's mother."
p58375
aS'Ah, who is Emma?'
p58376
aS'I told you about my daughter.'
p58377
aS'This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!'
p58378
aS'And done!'
p58379
aS"Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon"
p58380
aa(lp58381
S'Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?'
p58382
aS'Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!'
p58383
aS'Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.'
p58384
aS'Thank you so much.'
p58385
aS'No problem.'
p58386
aS"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
p58387
aS'Yeah.'
p58388
aS'Comb my eyelashes.'
p58389
aS"Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters \xc2\x93I am so excited\xc2\x94. And make it bouncy!"
p58390
aS"Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands."
p58391
aa(lp58392
S"I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey."
p58393
aS"Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!"
p58394
aS'Really? In front of all this people?'
p58395
aS'And they love me!'
p58396
aS'Oh my God!'
p58397
aS'Yes, she gives the people what they want.'
p58398
aS'All right, watch!'
p58399
aS'"Tonight\'s the night we\'re gonna make it happen, tonight we\'ll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."'
p58400
aS"Are those my wife's nipples?"
p58401
aS"Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again."
p58402
aa(lp58403
S'I gotta stop this.'
p58404
aS'Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."'
p58405
aS'You, touching yourself, out!'
p58406
aS'Wow. She does that a lot!'
p58407
aS"Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!"
p58408
aS"What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?"
p58409
aS'Actually about an hour and a half.'
p58410
aS"I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
p58411
aS'You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!'
p58412
aS'Are you kidding?'
p58413
aa(lp58414
S'Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?'
p58415
aS"We'll see."
p58416
aS"Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
p58417
aS"I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
p58418
aS'How do you know about that?'
p58419
aS'Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...'
p58420
aS'Emma.'
p58421
aS'When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?'
p58422
aS"Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
p58423
aS"No, actually, see I had to pee, \xc2\x91cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites."
p58424
aa(lp58425
S"Ok, Michelle, it's time to go."
p58426
aS'Well, call me!'
p58427
aS'Ok.'
p58428
aS"No, wait, you don't have my phone number!"
p58429
aS"You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye."
p58430
aS'Score.'
p58431
aS'Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.'
p58432
aS"Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
p58433
aS'Oh, really!'
p58434
aS'Yeah.'
p58435
aa(lp58436
S'Oh, really!'
p58437
aS'Oh yeah.'
p58438
aS'What about the guy from the bar?'
p58439
aS'What? Who?'
p58440
aS'The guy you gave your number to.'
p58441
aS'Whoa, how do you know about that?'
p58442
aS"Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me."
p58443
aS"Why didn't I get that message?"
p58444
aS'What?'
p58445
aS"From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?"
p58446
aa(lp58447
S'Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?'
p58448
aS'Ross?'
p58449
aS'I never gave it to you.'
p58450
aS'Why?'
p58451
aS"I don't know."
p58452
aS'Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?'
p58453
aS'Who am I?'
p58454
aS'Yes.'
p58455
aS"I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!"
p58456
aS"Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!"
p58457
aa(lp58458
S"None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!"
p58459
aS"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, \xc2\x93what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird?\xc2\xbb And I say \xc2\x93No.You know what, it's not, because it works for us!\xc2\xbb But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!"
p58460
aS'Uh, clearly.'
p58461
aS"And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore."
p58462
aS'Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?'
p58463
aS'Hey!'
p58464
aS'Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?'
p58465
aS'Ha, oh, of course.'
p58466
aS'Thank you.'
p58467
aS'Your eyebrows look weird.'
p58468
aa(lp58469
S'\xc2\x93Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine.\xc2\x94 So you just touch yourself for anything?'
p58470
aS'Morning, roomie!'
p58471
aS'Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.'
p58472
aS"Fifth day's a charm."
p58473
aS"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're      making it so easy on me and Emma."
p58474
aS"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,      and when does she stop crying all night?"
p58475
aS"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you      tonight?"
p58476
aS"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,      so..."
p58477
aS"She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did      last night."
p58478
aS'Bye!'
p58479
aa(lp58480
S"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
p58481
aS"No, hey, it's been great."
p58482
aS'Yeah?'
p58483
aS"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using      a breast pump..."
p58484
aS"Yeah, that'll do it."
p58485
aS'Wow! So, how are you?'
p58486
aS"I'm, I'm okay."
p58487
aS'Really?'
p58488
aS"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's      a divorce."
p58489
aS'Well, actually it...'
p58490
aa(lp58491
S"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing      other people."
p58492
aS'Wow, really?'
p58493
aS'Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good      for me...'
p58494
aS'Sure, I know lots of girls.'
p58495
aS'Yeah? Any names come to mind?'
p58496
aS'Ooh, names?'
p58497
aS'Hey.'
p58498
aS'Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?'
p58499
aS'What you got?'
p58500
aS"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,      strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet."
p58501
aa(lp58502
S'Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart      from the great food.'
p58503
aS"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
p58504
aS'Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.'
p58505
aS'Why are they doing this?'
p58506
aS"I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy."
p58507
aS"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in      here?"
p58508
aS"I just wish they'd realise they should be together."
p58509
aS"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,      that's where things were headed."
p58510
aS'I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have      more children.'
p58511
aS"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
p58512
aa(lp58513
S"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
p58514
aS"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
p58515
aS'So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them      up with people?'
p58516
aS'I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.'
p58517
aS"Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
p58518
aS"Ooh, that's a great plan!"
p58519
aS'Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."'
p58520
aS"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
p58521
aS'Hey!'
p58522
aS'Hey!'
p58523
aa(lp58524
S"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
p58525
aS"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
p58526
aS"I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight."
p58527
aS"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
p58528
aS'Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.'
p58529
aS'Oh my god.'
p58530
aS'Wow.'
p58531
aS"Why? What's the big deal?"
p58532
aS"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
p58533
aS"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
p58534
aa(lp58535
S"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
p58536
aS'You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!'
p58537
aS"So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?"
p58538
aS"Oh, it's perfect."
p58539
aS"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
p58540
aS'Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.'
p58541
aS'Ooh, Joey.'
p58542
aS'Hey.'
p58543
aS"Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight."
p58544
aS'All right! Who is he?'
p58545
aa(lp58546
S"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
p58547
aS'Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got      for Ross.'
p58548
aS'Oh, yeah.'
p58549
aS"She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!"
p58550
aS'A teacher?'
p58551
aS"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
p58552
aS"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!"
p58553
aS"Oh my god, you're right!"
p58554
aS'Yeah.'
p58555
aS'She even reads for pleasure!'
p58556
aa(lp58557
S'How do you even know a woman like that?'
p58558
aS"What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?"
p58559
aS'Joey.'
p58560
aS'I met her at the library. I went in to pee.'
p58561
aS'So now what do we do?'
p58562
aS"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,      and find him somebody else."
p58563
aS"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets      stood up!"
p58564
aS"Ooh...I hear that's bad."
p58565
aS"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
p58566
aS'Ah, yes, The Plan!'
p58567
aa(lp58568
S"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's..."
p58569
aS"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
p58570
aS'No, I think we killed it.'
p58571
aS"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
p58572
aS"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
p58573
aS"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
p58574
aS"I don't do that."
p58575
aS"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
p58576
aS'Yeah.'
p58577
aS'Today is the sixth.'
p58578
aa(lp58579
S"No, it's not."
p58580
aS"Yes, it's also 2003."
p58581
aS"Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant."
p58582
aS"It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay."
p58583
aS'Okay.'
p58584
aS'Tough crib.'
p58585
aS"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
p58586
aS'I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.'
p58587
aS'Chandler!'
p58588
aS"I am not working. There's not much to do around here!"
p58589
aa(lp58590
S'Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?'
p58591
aS"Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy."
p58592
aS"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
p58593
aS'Can I get you another glass of wine?'
p58594
aS"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home      alone."
p58595
aS'Got stood up, huh?'
p58596
aS"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date."
p58597
aS'Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?'
p58598
aS'No!'
p58599
aS"We're okay. I'm still ovulating."
p58600
aa(lp58601
S"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
p58602
aS"So, let's do this."
p58603
aS"I - I don't think I can."
p58604
aS"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
p58605
aS'Because of Emma.'
p58606
aS"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
p58607
aS'Sorry.'
p58608
aS'Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware      of at this age?'
p58609
aS"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...      canoodling in it."
p58610
aS'Canoodling?'
p58611
aa(lp58612
S'Well, I can\'t say "hump" or "screw" in front      of the B-A-B-Y.'
p58613
aS"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't      so..."
p58614
aS'Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?'
p58615
aS"I guess you're right."
p58616
aS"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through      the window."
p58617
aS'But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?'
p58618
aS"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
p58619
aS"I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful."
p58620
aS"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
p58621
aS"I'm kind of funny looking."
p58622
aa(lp58623
S'What?'
p58624
aS'Oh, come on, you\'re way out of my league. Everybody in here knows      it. Bet that guy over there\'s probably saying, "ooh, why she out with      him? He must be rich!" Well, I\'m not!'
p58625
aS"So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really      excited about that chicken."
p58626
aS'I\'m not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he\'s      not that good-looking, but maybe we\'ll have some laughs"... That ain\'t      gonna happen.'
p58627
aS"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.      That's impressive."
p58628
aS'I lost it. To drugs.'
p58629
aS'I silk-screen t-shirts now.'
p58630
aS"Really? What's that like?"
p58631
aS"It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's      right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with      two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile."
p58632
aS'Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something      that you like about yourself.'
p58633
aa(lp58634
S'I do like my hair.'
p58635
aS'Really?'
p58636
aS'Hello?'
p58637
aS"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
p58638
aS'Hey, Rach!'
p58639
aS'This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?'
p58640
aS'You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.'
p58641
aS"I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!"
p58642
aS"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
p58643
aS"He's not stoned."
p58644
aa(lp58645
S'Did he go out for a cigarette?'
p58646
aS'Yeah, four times.'
p58647
aS'My dear, sweet Rach.'
p58648
aS'Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable      time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.'
p58649
aS"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
p58650
aS"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny      Mexico.  Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
p58651
aS"She's asleep. Chandler?"
p58652
aS'What are you doing?'
p58653
aS'Emma was doing it!'
p58654
aS"She's asleep."
p58655
aa(lp58656
S"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
p58657
aS'Yes, but we have to be fast.'
p58658
aS"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
p58659
aS"Okay, I'll try."
p58660
aS'Hello?'
p58661
aS'Emma? Hey! Hi!'
p58662
aS"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the      bedroom door closed?"
p58663
aS"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
p58664
aS"I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left."
p58665
aS"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
p58666
aa(lp58667
S"Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.      Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on      the house."
p58668
aS"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to      have sex tonight."
p58669
aS'Ooh...'
p58670
aS'Just the crab cakes.'
p58671
aS"What are you      doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that."
p58672
aS'Just get out of here, okay?'
p58673
aS"What's - what's going on?"
p58674
aS"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on      how long it'll take before you give up and go home."
p58675
aS"What? You - you're making money off my misery?"
p58676
aS'Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.'
p58677
aa(lp58678
S"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
p58679
aS'Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.'
p58680
aS'I think we may have really done it this time.'
p58681
aS"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
p58682
aS'You may wanna get some more of those too.'
p58683
aS"Where's Emma?"
p58684
aS"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
p58685
aS"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
p58686
aS"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
p58687
aS'Okay.'
p58688
aa(lp58689
S"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,      we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
p58690
aS"I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must      think I'm so pathetic."
p58691
aS'No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.'
p58692
aS'Really?'
p58693
aS"Don't touch my coat!"
p58694
aS"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
p58695
aS"Hey, Rach, how's it going?"
p58696
aS'Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!'
p58697
aS"Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think      that this was going well?  What's up?"
p58698
aS'Hey, did you stop by here?'
p58699
aa(lp58700
S'No.'
p58701
aS'Oh my god, then...'
p58702
aS'Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!'
p58703
aS'What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?'
p58704
aS'Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just \xc2\x96 she loves      it when I\'m dramatic.'
p58705
aS'Why the hell did you take her?'
p58706
aS'Because you two were having sex!'
p58707
aS"No, we weren't!"
p58708
aS"Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.       You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?"
p58709
aS"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's      ovulating."
p58710
aa(lp58711
S"Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this."
p58712
aS'No, no, no.'
p58713
aS"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
p58714
aS'Hey, I gotta! Unless...'
p58715
aS'Unless what?'
p58716
aS'Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.'
p58717
aS'What? Why?'
p58718
aS"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family      name."
p58719
aS'Your family name is Tribbiani.'
p58720
aS'You almost had me.'
p58721
aa(lp58722
S'Well, uh...'
p58723
aS'Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you      like to make love to me?'
p58724
aS'Really, really not.'
p58725
aS"Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway."
p58726
aS"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
p58727
aS"Hey, what's wrong?"
p58728
aS'I just had a rough night.'
p58729
aS'Oh. Crab cake?'
p58730
aS'Eww!'
p58731
aS'Well, what happened?'
p58732
aa(lp58733
S"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
p58734
aS'Monica told me you had a blind date.'
p58735
aS'Yeah.'
p58736
aS'I did, too.'
p58737
aS'Oh.'
p58738
aS"But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?"
p58739
aS'Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?'
p58740
aS'Why does everyone keep saying that?'
p58741
aS"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown      up."
p58742
aS'That bad?'
p58743
aa(lp58744
S'Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be      appropriate to give me this.'
p58745
aS'Female body inspector? What size is that?'
p58746
aS"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
p58747
aS'Uh-huh.'
p58748
aS'How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?'
p58749
aS"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
p58750
aS'Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.'
p58751
aS"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
p58752
aS"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
p58753
aS"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
p58754
aa(lp58755
S"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you      up on a date that didn't even show."
p58756
aS"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's      just stupid."
p58757
aS"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really      bonding."
p58758
aS"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
p58759
aS"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.      They're coming this way. Run!"
p58760
aS'Where?'
p58761
aS'Mexico!'
p58762
aS"Can you believe they're still not here?"
p58763
aS'I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the      chances?'
p58764
aS"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
p58765
aa(lp58766
S'What?'
p58767
aS"We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes."
p58768
aS"Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we      do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry."
p58769
aS'I have such fat hands!'
p58770
aS"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.."
p58771
aS"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!"
p58772
aS"Really?  Let's get past the moment."
p58773
aS"What's your news?"
p58774
aS'Thank you. I got a job in advertising.'
p58775
aS"Oh, honey, that's incredible!"
p58776
aa(lp58777
S"Gosh, what's the pay like?  Oh, come on people..  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey!"
p58778
aS"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship."
p58779
aS"Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'."
p58780
aS"Right. So, it'll be the same except.. less sex with you."
p58781
aS"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
p58782
aS"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
p58783
aS"That's great."
p58784
aS"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating"
p58785
aS'Humiliating and noble!'
p58786
aS"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising."
p58787
aa(lp58788
S'Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"'
p58789
aS'Yes, I did, I did!  I should have written it down!'
p58790
aS'Hey!'
p58791
aS'Hey!'
p58792
aS"Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.  ... and I smelled bacon."
p58793
aS'He just left.'
p58794
aS'Who did?'
p58795
aS'Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.'
p58796
aS'She did?'
p58797
aS'You got it!'
p58798
aa(lp58799
S'I did?'
p58800
aS'What is she talking about?'
p58801
aS"I don't know, but it sounds great."
p58802
aS'Your agent called. You got that audition.'
p58803
aS'With Lennart Haze?'
p58804
aS'Yes.'
p58805
aS'Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway.. and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.'
p58806
aS'Is it a good play?'
p58807
aS"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
p58808
aS'Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it..'
p58809
aa(lp58810
S'Yeah, yeah, and directing.'
p58811
aS'He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.'
p58812
aS'You saw that?'
p58813
aS'No, but.. I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.'
p58814
aS'Ah!'
p58815
aS"Yeah, he's done some amazing works."
p58816
aS'Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.'
p58817
aS'I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.'
p58818
aS'Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!'
p58819
aS"Don't make me more nervous than I already am!"
p58820
aa(lp58821
S'Good morning, everybody.'
p58822
aS'Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?'
p58823
aS"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys.. except for the tie, the briefcase.. and the fact that I can rent a car."
p58824
aS"Seriously, you're an intern?"
p58825
aS"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
p58826
aS'Dude!'
p58827
aS"Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope"
p58828
aS'The comedian? USO?!'
p58829
aS"Uhm, it's USA, sir."
p58830
aS'This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.'
p58831
aa(lp58832
S"It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work."
p58833
aS"Well, I've.. I've been blessed with a.. a lot of great roles."
p58834
aS'Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"'
p58835
aS"You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service."
p58836
aS"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
p58837
aS'Really?'
p58838
aS'Yeah.'
p58839
aS'Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.'
p58840
aS"Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.."
p58841
aS'Peeeeeooooooooch  "Hang up that phone!" One take!'
p58842
aa(lp58843
S'Wow!'
p58844
aS'So, shall we read?'
p58845
aS'Oh, yah, sure.'
p58846
aS'Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?'
p58847
aS'"What the hell are you still doing here"?'
p58848
aS'Err, "I think you know".'
p58849
aS'"Bastard"!'
p58850
aS'"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."'
p58851
aS'"Go, go!"'
p58852
aS'"I can\'t. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can\'t."'
p58853
aa(lp58854
S'I\'m sorry, sorry. You\'re not supposed to say "long pause"'
p58855
aS"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a.."
p58856
aS'No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.'
p58857
aS'Ah, y-y-you\'re sure you don\'t want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  "I could go right now, maaan!"'
p58858
aS'My god in heaven.'
p58859
aS'Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?'
p58860
aS"You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. ."
p58861
aS"Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door."
p58862
aS"Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also:  'How you doing?'  You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please."
p58863
aS'Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?'
p58864
aa(lp58865
S'Yeah.'
p58866
aS"Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much."
p58867
aS'I really doubt that.'
p58868
aS"No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you."
p58869
aS"Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?"
p58870
aS'Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?'
p58871
aS"Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her."
p58872
aS'Oh, I hear divorce bells.'
p58873
aS"Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem."
p58874
aS'What?'
p58875
aa(lp58876
S'I have a gun'
p58877
aS"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."
p58878
aS'Alright, lady, now give me your purse!'
p58879
aS'No.'
p58880
aS'What do you mean "no"? I knew you\'d be my death, Phoebe Buffay.'
p58881
aS'Lowell, is that you?'
p58882
aS'Phoebe?  Oh my god!'
p58883
aS'Oh my god!'
p58884
aS"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross."
p58885
aS'Ross, nice to meet you.'
p58886
aa(lp58887
S'Yeah, a real pleasure.'
p58888
aS"Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!"
p58889
aS'Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!'
p58890
aS'Good for you!'
p58891
aS"So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?"
p58892
aS'Ouh..'
p58893
aS'Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?'
p58894
aS'Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up..'
p58895
aS'Hey, how did the audition go?'
p58896
aS'Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.'
p58897
aa(lp58898
S'What happened?'
p58899
aS"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less."
p58900
aS'So far so good!'
p58901
aS"Honey, I'm old!"
p58902
aS"What's wrong?"
p58903
aS"I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them."
p58904
aS"So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience."
p58905
aS"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these."
p58906
aS"Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!"
p58907
aS'What are they?'
p58908
aa(lp58909
S"They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these."
p58910
aS'I give you $ 500 for them!'
p58911
aS'What am I supposed to do with these?'
p58912
aS'Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.'
p58913
aS'Well, first of all, they\'re not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they\'re called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps".  And here, look: they\'ve got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around \'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?'
p58914
aS'Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?'
p58915
aS"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
p58916
aS"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?"
p58917
aS'Hey, hey!'
p58918
aS"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened.. Phoebe and I got mugged!"
p58919
aa(lp58920
S'You okay?!'
p58921
aS'Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!'
p58922
aS'How do you know a mugger?'
p58923
aS"I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us."
p58924
aS'You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.'
p58925
aS'Seriously?'
p58926
aS"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know.. sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.."
p58927
aS'Phoebe, that is awful!'
p58928
aS"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.. I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.."
p58929
aS"You're mother killed herself!"
p58930
aa(lp58931
S'She was a drug dealer!'
p58932
aS'Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!'
p58933
aS'Okay..'
p58934
aS"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross."
p58935
aS'Why?'
p58936
aS'Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.'
p58937
aS'You were?'
p58938
aS"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics.. you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-"
p58939
aS'Wonderwoman!'
p58940
aS'Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone..  .. when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"'
p58941
aa(lp58942
S'Oh my god..'
p58943
aS'I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"'
p58944
aS'Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?'
p58945
aS'A superhuman thirst for knowledge.'
p58946
aS"That's it."
p58947
aS'Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?'
p58948
aS"No.. actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street.. that's where stabby Joe works."
p58949
aS'Okay, I think we have a problem here.'
p58950
aS'What?'
p58951
aS"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics."
p58952
aa(lp58953
S'Yeah?'
p58954
aS'Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.'
p58955
aS'So?'
p58956
aS'Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-'
p58957
aS'"Geology rocks!"'
p58958
aS'Oh my god!'
p58959
aS'I know.. I mugged Ross!'
p58960
aS"You're late!"
p58961
aS"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
p58962
aS"No, Lennart doesn't wait!"
p58963
aa(lp58964
S"But I'm bursting with u-hu!"
p58965
aS"Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!"
p58966
aS'Actually, I really need..'
p58967
aS'We must go now, quickly, please.'
p58968
aS'Yes.. ahahaaa'
p58969
aS'Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"'
p58970
aS'"I think you know!"'
p58971

p58972

aa(lp58975
S'"I could go right now."'
p58976
aS'"Then go, go!"'
p58977
aS'"I, oh, I can\'t. I want to, but I can\'t!"'
p58978
aS'Cut! That was good.  That was very good. You did everything I asked for.'
p58979
aS'I did?'
p58980
aS"Yes. Plus.. what you've got that.. I don't know what you've got going.. this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but \xc2\x96 you know what? \xc2\x96 more, more. Can you do that?"
p58981
aS"Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go."
p58982
aS"Look at that: still in character, I like it.. I plant seeds I can't explain."
p58983
aS'Hey!'
p58984
aS'Hey!'
p58985
aa(lp58986
S'What are you doing?'
p58987
aS"Putting on the sneakers.. thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.."
p58988
aS'Oh, anything yet?'
p58989
aS"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
p58990
aS'Hey!'
p58991
aS'Hey!'
p58992
aS"Probably wanna know what I'm doing..?"
p58993
aS'No, that seems about right.'
p58994
aS"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
p58995
aS'Joey, that was formula.'
p58996
aa(lp58997
S'We gotta get more of that.'
p58998
aS"You know what.. these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren."
p58999
aS"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph."
p59000
aS'Alright  I feel youger already!'
p59001
aS'Yah, I think I broke my hip.'
p59002
aS'Hey, you!'
p59003
aS'Hey!'
p59004
aS'Hey, how was class?'
p59005
aS"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?"
p59006
aS'Nothing, I really wanna know.'
p59007
aa(lp59008
S'Oh..  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene..'
p59009
aS'Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make.. uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid..'
p59010
aS"Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude."
p59011
aS"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
p59012
aS"No, it wasn't."
p59013
aS'Yes, it was.'
p59014
aS"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.."
p59015
aS'"Gimme your money, punk!"'
p59016
aS"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you.. you mugged me?"
p59017
aS"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have.. have a great one!"
p59018
aa(lp59019
S"It's not the best!"
p59020
aS"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.."
p59021
aS"There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me."
p59022
aS'Really? Even more humiliating than..'
p59023
aS"Hey, let's not do this!"
p59024
aS'.. and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!'
p59025
aS"That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next?  Chander.."
p59026
aS"Okay..  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.."
p59027
aS'Your age?'
p59028
aS'A-huh. So he\'s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know.. maybe he falls.. maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"'
p59029
aa(lp59030
S"Chandler, that's great!"
p59031
aS"Oh, thank you, sir.. or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me"
p59032
aS"You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's...  You did you come up with that?"
p59033
aS"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
p59034
aS'That is great. Good work!'
p59035
aS'See all of you tomorrow.'
p59036
aS'The cold weather hurts my hip!'
p59037
aS"Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?"
p59038
aS'Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.'
p59039
aS"I just really wanted to apologize again and.. and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting."
p59040
aa(lp59041
S'Oh my god, crap from the street?'
p59042
aS'Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell.. or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"'
p59043
aS"Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?"
p59044
aS"I can't say, I just thought it was really good.. and.. maybe would be worth something some day."
p59045
aS'You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!'
p59046
aS'Yeah.. but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.'
p59047
aS'Still.. this is amazing.. Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.'
p59048
aS'You\'re welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him'
p59049
aS"You're welcome."
p59050

p59051
aa(lp59052
S'"I-I-I can\'t tell you somethin\' I don\'t know."'

p59054
aS'"I don\'t know!"'
p59055
aS'"I need an answer now!"'
p59056
aS'"Alright, here, you want an answer.. the answer.. is.."'
p59057
aS'Oh!'
p59058
aS'"She never loved me, she only loved you."'
p59059
aS'"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for \xc2\x96 Bang \xc2\x96 End Scene!"'
p59060
aS'Absolutely amazing!  The part is yours.'
p59061
aS'Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get..'
p59062
aa(lp59063
S'Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!  You can relax now. Yeah.'
p59064
aS"Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn.. on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!"
p59065
aS"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.."
p59066
aS'.. that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.'
p59067
aS"I see. You didn't happen to tell.."
p59068
aS'.. everybody we know? Yeah.'
p59069
aS'Great. Thanks!'
p59070
aS'Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?'
p59071
aS"I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since  I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all  our money?"
p59072
aS"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
p59073
aa(lp59074
S"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than  we're bringing in."
p59075
aS'Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.'
p59076
aS"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask  you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...  finding gold."
p59077
aS"You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal  out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next  month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's  refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing  soda and beer?"
p59078
aS'Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.'
p59079
aS"No! We're not borrowing money."
p59080
aS'Why not?'
p59081
aS"Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool  house... but the other thing was never borrow money."
p59082
aS'Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.'
p59083
aS"That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard."
p59084
aa(lp59085
S"I'm gonna go."
p59086
aS'Why??'
p59087
aS"I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more  clothes."
p59088
aS"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."
p59089
aS'I put that tube top on as a joke.'
p59090
aS'I want you to stay.'
p59091
aS"I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers  as I can.."
p59092
aS"Why don't you turn them inside ou..."
p59093
aS"Done it.  I'll be back in a couple  of hours."
p59094
aS"I'll miss you."
p59095
aa(lp59096
S"Me too.  You know  what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home."
p59097
aS"Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top."
p59098
aS"No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and  partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm  there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?"
p59099
aS'Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell  yeah!"'
p59100
aS"So we're doing it?"
p59101
aS"Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god, we're really going to move in together!"
p59102
aS'Yeah!'
p59103
aS'I\'ve always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put  down the toilet seat!" "No! We\'re not having sex anymore!" It\'s  gonna be fun!'
p59104
aS'Hey Joey!'
p59105
aS'Hey!'
p59106
aa(lp59107
S"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never  get back to Chandler."
p59108
aS"I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is  my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong."
p59109
aS"Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's  not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money."
p59110
aS"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always  a mistake."
p59111
aS'But Chandler lent you money!'
p59112
aS'And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.'
p59113
aS'Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.'
p59114
aS'Oh...how much?'
p59115
aS'Two thousand dollars?'
p59116
aS'Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?'
p59117
aa(lp59118
S'Yeah...'
p59119
aS"That's right I am!"
p59120
aS'Hi you guys!'
p59121
aS'Hey!'
p59122
aS"Oo...what's in the bag?"
p59123
aS'Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this  place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff  to baby-proof the apartment.'
p59124
aS'Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y\'know, when  I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or  er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!'
p59125
aS'Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?'
p59126
aS'No. I was just going to do this myself.'
p59127
aS"You're gonna do it?"
p59128
aa(lp59129
S"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?"
p59130
aS"Oh, women can. You can't."
p59131
aS'Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?'
p59132
aS"You're a pig. And you can't do this."
p59133
aS'Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!'
p59134
aS'The hardware store is right down the street.'
p59135
aS'There is a hardware store right down the street?'
p59136
aS"Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news."

p59139
aa(lp59140
S"I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before."
p59141
aS'Well you know it\'s just like living with a girl. Only they don\'t steal  your makeup. Unless they\'re playing "This is what my sister would look  like"'
p59142
aS"Yeah.... she's not so cute."
p59143
aS"I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
p59144
aS'Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.'
p59145
aS'Yes dear.'
p59146
aS'Is that a bit you guys do?'
p59147
aS"Uh huh...we're playing you two."
p59148

S"I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!  I mean...I'm happy for you guys.."
p59152
aS'I hear wedding bells.'
p59153
aS"Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You  know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.  Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that  highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house  in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send  Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do."
p59154
aS'Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.'
p59155
aS'I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a  soccer mom!'
p59156
aS'You ready to go?'
p59157
aS'Yeah! You bet roomy!'
p59158
aS"Don't you mean..groomy?"
p59159
aS'What are you talking about?'
p59160
aS"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have  us picking out china patterns."
p59161
aa(lp59162
S'China patterns!!!!!'
p59163

p59164
aS'Hey Joe!'
p59165
aS'Hey!'
p59166
aS"Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything  about it."
p59167
aS"I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica."
p59168
aS'And that would have made the official party line.  Monica  and I are having a little financial trouble.'
p59169
aS'Yeah, I know.'
p59170
aS'What? What do you mean you know?'
p59171
aS"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and  the economy is bad."
p59172
aa(lp59173
S'Oh! Right.'
p59174
aS"That's the fastest I have ever thought!"
p59175
aS'Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.'
p59176
aS'Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?'
p59177
aS'Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!'
p59178
aS'Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your  rent is.'
p59179
aS'Oh ok.'
p59180
aS'I am on fire!'
p59181
aS'Listen...this is really nice. Do you...   Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?  Did Monica borrow money from you?'
p59182
aS'Err... Kind of.'
p59183
aa(lp59184
S"I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?"
p59185
aS"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,  it was for something for her."
p59186
aS'What?'
p59187
aS'Something personal.'
p59188
aS"What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she  wouldn't tell me about?"
p59189
aS'Excuse me.'
p59190
aS'Boob job.'
p59191
aS"I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!"
p59192
aS"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would  be crazy."
p59193
aS'Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica\'s little "groomy" joke.'
p59194
aa(lp59195
S"Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's  a play on the word roomy."
p59196
aS"I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...  maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not  expecting a proposal, right?"
p59197
aS"Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where  it goes."
p59198
aS"Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go."
p59199
aS'What do you mean?'
p59200
aS'Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married  again.'
p59201
aS'Oh. Wow.'
p59202
aS"It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of  lost faith in the whole idea."
p59203
aS'Was it really that bad?'
p59204
aS'At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....'
p59205
aa(lp59206
S"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with  someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in  the ocean."
p59207
aS"Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time  I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!"
p59208
aS"But it's just..."
p59209
aS"Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again."
p59210
aS'Oh!'
p59211
aS"I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together  isn't the best idea."
p59212
aS"No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make  sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start  changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!"
p59213

p59220
aS'Oh thank you so much.  Oh oh wait!  You forgot your erm...Your game.'
p59221

p59223
aS"Don't look at me I never get his jokes."
p59224
aS'Thank you?'
p59225
aS"Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing  I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...  single things."
p59226
aS"Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?"
p59227
aa(lp59228
S'No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.'
p59229
aS"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still  ok."
p59230
aS"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.  I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more  specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
p59231
aS'Okay...'
p59232
aS"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would  you? Don't answer that."
p59233
aS"Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder."
p59234
aS'I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?'
p59235
aS"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?"
p59236
aS"Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting  to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change."
p59237
aS"No you really think that's what it is?"
p59238
aa(lp59239
S'You heard him! "No bigger!" "You\'re perfect!" "Just  don\'t get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling  coach. You know what? I\'m going to have to talk to Chandler.'
p59240
aS"Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your  breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose  bladder control.  God! It's just such a magical time!"
p59241
aS'Hi'
p59242
aS'Hey!'
p59243
aS'Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.'
p59244
aS"Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for  all hanging out but to come to my home!"
p59245
aS'No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.'

p59257
aS'If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer".  It\'s just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn\'t exactly work out. But I love  to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before  she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I\'m sorry.'

aS"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised  I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
p59301
aS'What do you mean?'
p59302
aS'Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in  the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly  picture yourself in a Volvo?'

p59308
aS'Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets  really tricky.'
p59309
aS'You know sometimes your words... they hurt.'
p59310
aS'Hey uh, where do you guys want this?'
p59311
aS"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I  mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
p59312
aS"Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle  room? None at all?"
p59313

p59320
aS"I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was  missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the  regular stuff."
p59321
aS"But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?"
p59322
aS"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and  I wanted to live with you."
p59323
aS"I want to live with you too! Let's do that!"
p59324
aS"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what  was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."

p59367
aS"Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?"
p59368

p59381
aa(lp59382
S"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
p59383
aS"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth"
p59384
aS"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
p59385
aS'Ok, you got it!'
p59386
aS"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."

aS"I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!"

p59407
aS"There you go sweetie...   This isn't over."
p59408
aS'Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...   "gay as the day is long"?'
p59409
aS'Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.'
p59410

p59422
aS'It kills over one americans every year.'

aS'God, I wish Mike were here.'
p59428
aS'Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?'
p59429
aS"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
p59430
aS"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
p59431
aS"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone."

p59455
aS"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
p59456
aS'Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...'
p59457
aS'Make the transfer!'
p59458
aa(lp59459

p59472
aS'Those are my shoes.'
p59473
aS'Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.'
p59474

p59484
aS'There is a speakerphone on the base unit...'
p59485
aS'Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!'

aS'Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...'
p59487

p59488
aS'Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!'
p59489
aS"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."

aS"Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?"
p59491
aa(lp59492
S"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend  and Mike's friend ."

p59506
aS'uhu uhu, check this out.'
p59507
aS"Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?"
p59508
aS'Eh..actually no, I don\'t need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn\'t work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I\'m dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I\'m dead!?'
p59509
aS"No, come on, you know that's not true."
p59510
aS"What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!"
p59511
aS'Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.'
p59512
aS"I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!"
p59513
aa(lp59514
S"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
p59515
aS"You're right. There isn't a decent outlet."
p59516
aS"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
p59517
aS'Exactly!!'
p59518
aS"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
p59519
aS"No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!"
p59520
aS"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
p59521
aS"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."

p59532
aS"... she's being unreasonable!"
p59533
aS"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"
p59534
aS'It does?'
p59535
aa(lp59536
S"Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much."

p59545
aS"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
p59546
aa(lp59547
S'I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?'
p59548
aS"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped."

p59586
aS'Who is he?'
p59587
aS'Some guy, Tom Gordon.'
p59588
aS"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives."
p59589
aS'So, did you know Ross well?'
p59590
aa(lp59591
S"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
p59592
aS'Yes, he is. Me.'
p59593
aS'What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?'
p59594
aS"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!"
p59595
aS'Hey, listen. Call me.'
p59596
aS'Ok!'
p59597

aS'I look like a man??'
p59599
aS'Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!'

p59601
aa(lp59602
S"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
p59603
aS"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
p59604
aS"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
p59605
aS'Yeah...'
p59606
aS"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide."
p59607
aS"Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service."

p59616
aS"I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad."
p59617
aS"I didn't know Ross and you were so close."
p59618
aS"We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him."
p59619
aS"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
p59620
aS'I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.'
p59621
aS"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
p59622
aS"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!"
p59623
aa(lp59624
S'Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!'
p59625
aS"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok?  Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless.  Monica?"

aS'Uh!'
p59642
aS'Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could reallyuse 300 million dollars.'

aS'No! Do you know what your odds are of winning thelottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck bylightning 42 times.'
p59655

aa(lp59657
S'I like those odds!'
p59658
aS"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going tospend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."

p60111
aS'Dude, none of this is cool.'
p60112
aS"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through."
p60113

S'Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.'
p60131
aS'What do you think brought than on?'
p60132
aS"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
p60133
aS'A love scene? With who?'
p60134
aS'Olivia.'
p60135
aS'Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.'
p60136
aS'So do you think that my dream means anything?'
p60137
aS"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
p60138
aS"Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream..."
p60139
aS"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college."

p60146
aS"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
p60147
aS"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
p60148
aS"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."

p60158
aS"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
p60159
aS"Well...it's not about quality."
p60160
aS"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."
p60161
aS"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
p60162
aa(lp60163
S"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
p60164
aS'Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?'
p60165
aS'You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.'

p60191
aS'Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!'
p60192
aS'Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .'
p60193
aS'Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?'
p60194
aS'Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?'
p60195
aa(lp60196
S'Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .'
p60197
aS"Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?"
p60198
aS"Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!"
p60199
aS"I'm sorry..."
p60200
aS"I'm sorry too..."
p60201
aS"ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?"

aS'How...how...?'
p60210
aS'I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?'
p60211
aS'uh-huh'
p60212

p60213
aS'Wow...definitely just Drake...'
p60214
aS'What?'
p60215
aS'What...how is it going with Drake?'
p60216
aS"Oh...I don't think it's going very well..."
p60217
aa(lp60218
S'What...that scene I saw was so good!'
p60219
aS"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
p60220
aS"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
p60221
aS"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
p60222
aS'So?'
p60223
aS"So...I've never played that!"
p60224
aS"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
p60225
aS'Uh...well...just once...with you...'
p60226
aS"Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?"
p60227
aS'What the hell are you talking about??'
p60228
aa(lp60229
S"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
p60230
aS"Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
p60231
aS'Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...'
p60232
aS"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
p60233
aS'Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!'
p60234
aS'I got you something from Vermont!'
p60235

aS"Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?"
p60463
aS'... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.'
p60464
aS'Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?'
p60465
aS'No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.'
p60466
aS'Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?'
p60467
aS'Hey Ross!'
p60468
aS'How is it going with Charlie?'
p60469
aS"Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out."
p60470
aa(lp60471
S"Oh, What's the matter?"
p60472
aS'She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.'
p60473
aS'I always loved that!!'
p60474
aS"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!"
p60475
aS'Worse?'
p60476
aS'Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  "Can we walk"?  Oh, you... you like that?'
p60477
aS'No.'
p60478
aS'What?'
p60479
aS'Come on! I think this is funny!'
p60480
aS'Well, I bet you are all thinkin\' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?'
p60481
aa(lp60482
S'oh yes, God yes!!'
p60483
aS"Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.  How could he leave me?!?!"
p60484
aS"I... I don't know... you seem lovely."
p60485
aS'Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.'
p60486
aS'Nice to meet you.'
p60487
aS'Hey! So what show are you on?'
p60488
aS"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
p60489
aS"It's a science."
p60490
aS'Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.'
p60491
aS'Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...'
p60492
aa(lp60493
S'Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.'
p60494
aS'Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.'
p60495
aS"I'd lead with that."
p60496
aS"That's it, just sign right on the bra ."
p60497
aS'Monica!'
p60498
aS"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
p60499
aS'What have you got there?'
p60500
aS'Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.'
p60501
aS"Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"
p60502
aS'I think I am.'
p60503
aa(lp60504
S"Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
p60505
aS'Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...'
p60506
aS"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
p60507
aS"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
p60508
aS"Joey, you're so sweet."
p60509
aS"That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
p60510
aS'Who ?'
p60511
aS'Me.'
p60512
aS'What?  Really?'
p60513
aS"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
p60514
aa(lp60515
S"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!"
p60516
aS'Gotcha.'
p60517
aS'Oh, Very funny... Joey.'
p60518
aS'So, how did you enjoy the play?'
p60519
aS"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
p60520
aS'Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.'
p60521
aS'You really liked it?'
p60522
aS'Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn\'t I, because as a man I\'ve been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.'
p60523
aS'Oh really!'
p60524
aS'Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!'
p60525
aa(lp60526
S'No!'
p60527
aS'Did somebody sign your bra?'
p60528
aS'So I got it when I was 13...'
p60529
aS'Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?'
p60530
aS"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
p60531
aS"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd."
p60532
aS"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
p60533
aS"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
p60534
aS'And sexy.'
p60535
aS'Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!'
p60536
aa(lp60537
S"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
p60538
aS'Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!'
p60539
aS'Stop going through my stuff !'
p60540
aS'Hey!'
p60541
aS'Hey!'
p60542
aS"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
p60543
aS"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
p60544
aS'Please, what about you and Chandler?'
p60545
aS"That's different! I was drunk and stupid!"
p60546
aS'Well hello !'
p60547
aa(lp60548
S"What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?"
p60549
aS"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
p60550
aS"Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision."
p60551
aS"I'm gonna do it."
p60552
aS"And I can't stop you."
p60553
aS'No.'
p60554
aS'Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?'
p60555
aS"I'm smarter than him!"
p60556
aS'Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.'
p60557
aS'Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.'
p60558
aa(lp60559
S"Oh, you're so wonderful."

p60563
aS"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?   I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
p60564
aS"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!"
p60565
aS"I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?"
p60566
aS'Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did   not kiss.'
p60567
aS"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls   at the party, GOD!"
p60568
aS'Why do you care so much?'
p60569
aa(lp60570
S'Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?'
p60571
aS"Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know...   and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying   is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common."
p60572
aS"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each   other's tonsils..."
p60573
aS"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids   and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,   those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
p60574
aS"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
p60575
aS"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with   it..."
p60576
aS'Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!'
p60577
aS'Hey!'
p60578
aS'Hi!'

aS"I'm gonna get some more coffee."

p60582
aS'Ok.'
p60583
aS'So, a professor, uh?'
p60584
aS"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious   .  That's not   how she used it...?"
p60585
aS"I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't   ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed.   I really hope you don't think less of me."
p60586
aS"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,   you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like   someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
p60587
aS"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,   Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,   and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you   know, very cerebral..."
p60588
aS'Yeah, I know the type.'
p60589
aS"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.   No? Am I getting close?"

aS'Hey you guys! Look what I just got.'

p60595
aS'I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania   Twain.'
p60596
aS'Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!'
p60597
aS'Oh... then I overpaid.'
p60598
aS"Hey, what's this?"
p60599
aS"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
p60600
aS"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage   chains."
p60601
aS"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things   that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."

aS'Well, I would like to have the option!!'
p60605
aS"What's up?  Hey, Rachel!!"

p60609
aS"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing   away a hundred bucks!"

p60613
aa(lp60614
S'Oh!'
p60615

p60617
aS'Promise?'

aS'We really need to take those tests?'

aS"It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do   it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?"
p60633
aS"I cannot believe Ross told you that!    And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
p60634
aS"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think   it's a good idea!"
p60635
aa(lp60636

p60677
aS'Sorry, everyone is booked!'

p60679
aa(lp60680
S'Then why you work here?'
p60681
aS"'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that   this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!"

aS'Are you wearing two belts?'
p60695
aS'EH, what do you know!'

p60705
aS'Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.'
p60706

p60707
aS"Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry   baseball fans!"
p60708
aS"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
p60709
aS"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore   on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,   you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the   Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that   she'd love."

aS'Ah! I\'m an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"   I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".'
p60765
aS'Wow. What does that mean?'
p60766
aS'No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I   guess it means "you\'re gonna get eaten by a bear".'
p60767
aa(lp60768
S"Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"
p60769
aS"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish   of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
p60770
aS"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing   and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
p60771
aS'Come on! you...'
p60772
aS'No!'
p60773
aS"My specimen is in the   room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.   Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! You're not... gone?"
p60774
aS"Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so   this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?"
p60775
aS'Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!'
p60776
aS"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes   next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
p60777
aS"I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...   I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."
p60778
aa(lp60779
S'Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.'
p60780
aS"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there   is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
p60781
aS"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.   I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
p60782
aS"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe   I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'..."
p60783
aS"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you   can't do it at a doctor's office?"
p60784
aS'It was a "Wendy\'s!!   "'
p60785
aS'"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is   the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!'
p60786
aS'Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have   a friend who is a masseuse.'
p60787
aS'Oh, Ja! Ja!'
p60788
aS"Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though..."
p60789
aa(lp60790
S'Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?'
p60791
aS"I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy   fingers from playing crummy guitar..."
p60792
aS"Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're   such a high maintenance tight ass!"
p60793
aS'Phoebe!!'
p60794
aS"You know it's me?"
p60795
aS'For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!'
p60796
aS'How can you come here?'
p60797
aS'How could you not tell me you worked here?'
p60798
aS"I don't have to tell you everything!"
p60799
aS"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting   a free massage!"
p60800
aa(lp60801
S'Tips not included.'
p60802
aS'Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?'
p60803
aS"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then   they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...   you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!   paying taxes!"
p60804
aS"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there   right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles   and I so admire that! I don't have any!"
p60805
aS"You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time   I took my life back!"
p60806
aS'Good for you Pheebs!'
p60807
aS'Ok.'
p60808
aS"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any   of that. I love you."
p60809
aS'Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!'
p60810
aS'Respectfully, professor   R. Geller.  Hey!'
p60811
aa(lp60812
S'Hi!'
p60813
aS'Hey, how was the Met?'
p60814
aS'The museum was amazing!'
p60815
aS'Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?'
p60816
aS"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to   say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
p60817
aS'What do you mean?'
p60818
aS'Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere   around.'
p60819
aS'Wait a minute... when you guys walked   into the Met, did you go to the right?'
p60820
aS'No, we went to the left.'
p60821
aS'Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like   you guys are having a great time together.'
p60822
aa(lp60823
S"Yeah, it's fun ."
p60824
aS'What?'
p60825
aS"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really   know me that well; it would be weird."
p60826
aS'What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.'
p60827
aS"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy   to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common   with. You know what I mean?"
p60828
aS"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey   a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about   art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
p60829
aS"Yeah, I guess that's true."
p60830
aS"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all   that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You   know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
p60831
aS"He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!"
p60832
aS'That was going to be my next argument.'
p60833
aa(lp60834
S'Hey!'
p60835
aS'Hey!'
p60836
aS'Hey!'
p60837
aS"You're ready?"
p60838
aS"Yeah, let's go.   Thanks   Ross."
p60839
aS'Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me   up.'
p60840
aS'Glad I could help man.'
p60841
aS"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna   be, but...  I made it work."
p60842
aS"It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now."
p60843
aS"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not here   but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean?    Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks."
p60844
aa(lp60845
S'Hey sweetie.'
p60846
aS'Doctor Connelly just called.'
p60847
aS'With good news?  Of course   it is not good news, you just said  "Doctor Connelly just called".   If it was good news you would have said  "Doctor Connelly just   called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem   with me or with you?'
p60848
aS"Actually it's both of us."
p60849
aS'What?'
p60850
aS'Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment.'
p60851
aS'Oh... what does that mean?'
p60852
aS"It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers   and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It   means..."
p60853
aS'Chandler?'
p60854
aS"It means that we can keep trying, but there's   a good chance this may never happen for us."
p60855
aa(lp60856
S'Oh my God!'
p60857
aS"I'm sorry."
p60858
aS"I'm sorry too."
p60859
aS"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
p60860
aS'I know.'
p60861
aS'Good morning Phoebe.'
p60862
aS'Good morning receptionist.'
p60863
aS"Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is   in room No. 1."
p60864
aS'Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch, she came back?'
p60865
aS'Are you ready for   your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.'
p60866
aa(lp60867
S'Oh! That feels sooo good!'
p60868
aS'Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!'
p60869
aS"I'm sorry, what?"
p60870
aS"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."
p60871
aS'From... Cosmo??'
p60872
aS'Yeah, yeah... It\'s... "climax your way to better skin".'
p60873
aS"So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
p60874
aS'So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.'
p60875
aS'Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!'
p60876
aS'Oh hey Rach!'
p60877
aa(lp60878
S'Yeah...'
p60879
aS'Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.'
p60880
aS'Oh, well...'
p60881
aS"I'm sure you have better things to do."
p60882
aS"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
p60883
aS"If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help."
p60884
aS"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"
p60885
aS"Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
p60886
aS"Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off, right?"
p60887
aS"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
p60888
aa(lp60889
S'Oh... Mike\'s sister just invited me to a party tonight, he\'s gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don\'t worry! I asked him. He\'s totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he\'ll think that I\'m totally ok with seeing him!'
p60890
aS"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
p60891
aS'Exactly!'
p60892
aS"And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!"
p60893
aS"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh, sexual politics!!"
p60894
aS"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
p60895
aS"Ok, that'll be great!"
p60896
aS"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
p60897
aS"That's not what we're gonna do!"
p60898
aS"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
p60899
aa(lp60900
S'Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!'
p60901
aS"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
p60902
aS"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
p60903
aS'Hi there.'
p60904
aS'Hi.'
p60905
aS'Hi.'
p60906
aS"I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options."
p60907
aS'Ok.'
p60908
aS"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis."
p60909
aS'Oh, DAMN IT!'
p60910
aa(lp60911
S"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
p60912
aS'Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.'
p60913
aS'Ok.'
p60914
aS'And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.'
p60915
aS"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
p60916
aS"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
p60917
aS"Oh, yeah! Let's do it!"
p60918
aS'Alright, have a good time.'
p60919
aS'Not gonna find any clothes in there!'
p60920
aS'Hey, you guys!'
p60921
aa(lp60922
S'Hi.'
p60923
aS"Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?"
p60924
aS'Umh... Kurts Baley?'
p60925
aS'Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?'
p60926
aS"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
p60927
aS"So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?"
p60928
aS"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."
p60929
aS"He's a pretty tough guy to impress."
p60930
aS'Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.'
p60931
aS"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
p60932
aa(lp60933
S'Tsz... NO! .'
p60934
aS'Hey guys!'
p60935
aS"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
p60936
aS'I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.'
p60937
aS"It's in Barbados."
p60938
aS'But you come first!'
p60939
aS"I'm there!"
p60940
aS"We'll see you, guys!"
p60941
aS'Bye.'
p60942
aS'Bye, see ya.'
p60943
aa(lp60944
S'Ok.'
p60945
aS'All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?'
p60946
aS"Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample."
p60947
aS'So-so what did the doctor say?'
p60948
aS"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
p60949
aS"So you're ruling out surrogacy?"
p60950
aS'Yeah.'
p60951
aS"So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
p60952
aS"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
p60953
aS"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
p60954
aa(lp60955
S'ah-ha!'
p60956
aS'How do you feel about all this?'
p60957
aS"I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one."
p60958
aS'Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!'
p60959
aS'What?'
p60960
aS'What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!'
p60961
aS'The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.'
p60962
aS'Mmm-mm.'
p60963
aS"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
p60964
aS"Oh, that's not what you want..."
p60965
aa(lp60966
S'Incentive For Men?'
p60967
aS"Oh, I'll take some of that."
p60968
aS"Pheebs, that's for men!"
p60969
aS"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah."
p60970
aS"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"
p60971
aS'So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?'
p60972
aS'On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.'
p60973
aS'See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.'
p60974
aS'Really?'
p60975
aS'Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?'
p60976
aa(lp60977
S"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."
p60978
aS"You've seen all the movies..."
p60979
aS"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"
p60980
aS'Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?'
p60981
aS'Sure!'
p60982
aS'Ok!'
p60983
aS'Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!'
p60984
aS"You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff."
p60985
aS'So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?'
p60986
aS"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
p60987
aa(lp60988
S'Why?'
p60989
aS"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
p60990
aS'Who else?'
p60991
aS"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
p60992
aS'You like Joey?'
p60993
aS'Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.'
p60994
aS'Oh my God!'
p60995
aS"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
p60996
aS"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
p60997
aS'Oh, I get it!'
p60998
aa(lp60999
S"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
p61000
aS'I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.'
p61001
aS'Yeah.'
p61002
aS'So can we keep this between us?'
p61003
aS'Sure!'
p61004
aS'Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!'
p61005
aS'Oh.'
p61006
aS'Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?'
p61007
aS'Hi honey!'
p61008
aS'Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!'
p61009
aa(lp61010
S"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
p61011
aS'You too.'
p61012
aS"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
p61013
aS'I got it.'
p61014
aS'Thanks.'
p61015
aS"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
p61016
aS'Yeah, I guess.'
p61017
aS"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
p61018
aS'Excuse me?'
p61019
aS'Well, we\'re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he\'s intelligent, he\'s healthy, he\'s athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!'
p61020
aa(lp61021
S'Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!'
p61022
aS'No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.'
p61023
aS'Chandler!'
p61024
aS"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
p61025
aS"I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!"
p61026
aS'Ok!'
p61027
aS'Uh!'
p61028
aS'Zack!'
p61029
aS"Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring."
p61030
aS'Tell me about yourself, Zack!'
p61031
aa(lp61032
S'Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!'
p61033
aS"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
p61034
aS'Ok, great!'
p61035
aS"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
p61036
aS"I didn't say anything yet!"
p61037
aS'Well, get back in there and talk!'
p61038
aS"I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends."
p61039
aS'What!?'
p61040
aS'Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.'
p61041
aS'Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!'
p61042
aa(lp61043
S'Ooh! We have a problem.'
p61044
aS'Oh! What are we gonna do?'
p61045
aS'Just be honest with her.'
p61046
aS'Oh my God!'
p61047
aS'And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...'
p61048
aS'Alright! Enough out of you!'
p61049
aS'Hello?'
p61050
aS'Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?'
p61051
aS"No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?"
p61052
aS"I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker..."
p61053
aa(lp61054
S"Oh! How's it going?"
p61055
aS'It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!'
p61056
aS'What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!'
p61057
aS'Barbados.'
p61058
aS"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
p61059
aS"What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder."
p61060
aS'Well, just wake him up!'
p61061
aS"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!"
p61062
aS"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
p61063
aS"Hey guys! Dinner's ready!"
p61064
aa(lp61065
S"Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!"
p61066
aS'So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!'
p61067
aS"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
p61068
aS"You don't like him."
p61069
aS"I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information."
p61070
aS'Alright! Just follow my lead!'
p61071
aS'You guys have such a great place here.'
p61072
aS"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
p61073
aS'Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.'
p61074
aS"That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack."
p61075
aa(lp61076
S'Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.'
p61077
aS"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
p61078
aS'No...'
p61079
aS'Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?'
p61080
aS"You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?"
p61081
aS"We're just making conversation."
p61082
aS"Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny..."
p61083
aS"You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness"
p61084
aS"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?"
p61085
aS'Sure! Alright...'
p61086
aa(lp61087
S"Ravioli's delicious!"
p61088
aS'I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?'
p61089
aS"No I didn't."
p61090
aS'Yess!!'
p61091
aS"We're teeth people Zack!"
p61092
aS"Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard."
p61093
aS'Good plan.'
p61094
aS'Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?'
p61095
aS'Oh! I\'m sorry Rachel, I don\'t have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who\'s more over who"!'
p61096
aS"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"
p61097
aa(lp61098
S'Oh! trying on clothes.'
p61099
aS"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"
p61100
aS'Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.'
p61101
aS'Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.'
p61102
aS"No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey."
p61103
aS'Yeah.'
p61104
aS"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
p61105
aS"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"
p61106
aS'Wow!'
p61107
aS'Yeah...'
p61108
aa(lp61109
S'You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.'
p61110
aS'I try...'
p61111
aS'Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!'
p61112
aS"You're welcome."
p61113
aS'Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!'
p61114
aS"Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party."
p61115
aS"Then don't go!"
p61116
aS"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
p61117
aS"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
p61118
aS"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
p61119
aa(lp61120
S'David?'
p61121
aS'Phoebe! Hi!'
p61122
aS'Oh my God!'
p61123
aS'Wow, you look unbelievable.'
p61124
aS'Yeah. What-what are you doing here?'
p61125
aS"Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently."
p61126
aS'What happened?'
p61127
aS'Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?'
p61128
aS'Yeah?'
p61129
aS"Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done."
p61130
aa(lp61131
S"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
p61132
aS'Good, good, life is good...'
p61133
aS'Good!'
p61134
aS"Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone."
p61135
aS'Oh, good for you.'
p61136
aS'She\'s also a scientist, so she\'s very smart and pretty and... well, it\'s actually because of you, really, that we\'re together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".'
p61137
aS'Mike and I broke up.'
p61138
aS"You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up."
p61139
aS'Really?'
p61140
aS"Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face."
p61141
aa(lp61142
S"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
p61143
aS'Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?'
p61144
aS'Well...  no.'
p61145
aS'Do you wanna get a drink?'
p61146
aS"I'd love to."
p61147
aS'Great.'
p61148
aS'Ok.'
p61149
aS'Do you smell beets?'
p61150
aS'Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.'
p61151
aS"Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?"
p61152
aa(lp61153
S"No, that's David."
p61154
aS"There's a third guy?"
p61155
aS'Tip of the iceberg.'
p61156
aS"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?"
p61157
aS"You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?"
p61158
aS"No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired."
p61159
aS"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
p61160
aS"No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow."
p61161
aS'Ok.'
p61162
aS"I think we've found our sperm!"
p61163
aa(lp61164
S'Does seem pretty perfect.'
p61165
aS'Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?'
p61166
aS'No.'
p61167
aS'Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!'
p61168
aS"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
p61169
aS"Yeah, he's better!"
p61170
aS"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
p61171
aS'Really? Are you sure?'
p61172
aS"Yeah, I'm sure."
p61173
aS"Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
p61174
aa(lp61175
S'That is so sweet. I love you.'
p61176
aS'So you know this leaves us with...'
p61177
aS'Adoption.'
p61178
aS'How do you feel about that?'
p61179
aS'I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.'
p61180
aS'Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.'
p61181
aS"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
p61182
aS'Yeah.'
p61183
aS"Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
p61184
aS'We are gonna be great parents.'
p61185
aa(lp61186
S'And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.'
p61187
aS"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
p61188
aS'Hey, Zack!'
p61189
aS'Hey Chandler.'
p61190
aS'Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.'
p61191
aS"No you didn't."
p61192
aS'Really?'
p61193
aS'No you did.'
p61194
aS"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
p61195
aS"Here are the boards for Friday's pitch ."
p61196
aa(lp61197
S'Oh, thank you.'
p61198
aS"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
p61199
aS"Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!"
p61200
aS"Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?"
p61201
aS'Mmh-mmh.'
p61202
aS'Can you say Barbados?'
p61203
aS'Barbados!'
p61204
aS"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
p61205
aS'Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?'
p61206
aS'Yeah Ross, I mean... we\'re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we\'re gonna wanna do, you know, "island\'s stuff".'
p61207
aa(lp61208
S'I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.'
p61209
aS"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
p61210
aS"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
p61211
aS"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
p61212
aS"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
p61213
aS"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
p61214
aS'Wow! This place is beautiful!'
p61215
aS'Look at all these paleontologists!!'
p61216
aS'I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!'
p61217
aS"Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!"
p61218
aa(lp61219
S"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
p61220
aS"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!"
p61221
aS'That... never happens...'
p61222
aS"I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech."
p61223
aS'Wow! This is very flattering, uh...'
p61224
aS'I would love your autograph.'
p61225
aS'Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..."'
p61226
aS'Sarah.'
p61227
aS'"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".'
p61228
aS'Thank you so much!'
p61229
aa(lp61230
S"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
p61231
aS'Are you a paleontologist?'
p61232
aS'No, God, no! No! No no, I\'m an actor. You\'d probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".'
p61233
aS'Dude, it\'s just "Days of Our Lives"... there\'s no the.'
p61234
aS"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
p61235
aS"I'm sorry, I don't own a TV."
p61236
aS"You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??"
p61237
aS"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
p61238
aS"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
p61239
aS'See?'
p61240
aa(lp61241
S'Yeah, that\'s the same as "it has something to do with wind".'
p61242
aS"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
p61243
aS'Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.'
p61244
aS"Mike?? Who's Mike?"
p61245
aS'Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!'
p61246
aS"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!"
p61247
aS"It's ok. Ho-honest mistake."
p61248
aS"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!"
p61249
aS'She does?'
p61250
aS"Let's get you out of here!!"
p61251
aa(lp61252
S'At least you took me down with you!'
p61253
aS"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
p61254
aS'I guess, in time.'
p61255
aS'Yeah.'
p61256
aS'I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.'
p61257
aS'You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!'
p61258
aS"Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?"
p61259
aS"I wouldn't read too much into it."
p61260
aS"Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?"
p61261
aS"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
p61262
aa(lp61263
S'Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...'
p61264
aS"Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
p61265
aS"I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?"
p61266
aS"Oh, because his penis was too big.  Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
p61267
aS"That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!"
p61268
aS'What?'
p61269
aS'Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.'
p61270
aS"I didn't mean now..."
p61271
aS"Why not? It's brilliant!  Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!  well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely."
p61272
aS"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
p61273
aa(lp61274
S'How do you think I should propose?'
p61275
aS"David, I'm pretending to read here!!"
p61276
aS"Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!"
p61277
aS"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
p61278
aS"I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs..."
p61279
aS'You really should have been more clear about that!'
p61280
aS'Hey!'
p61281
aS'Hey!'
p61282
aS"You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!"
p61283
aS'Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?'
p61284
aa(lp61285
S'Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!'
p61286
aS'Oh my God! Did you talk to him?'
p61287
aS'Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?'
p61288
aS'You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you\'re not Britney Spears?"'
p61289
aS'Ready to go?'
p61290
aS'Yeah!'
p61291
aS"Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?"
p61292
aS"Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech."
p61293
aS'Yeah.'
p61294
aS'But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.'
p61295
aa(lp61296
S'Will you wear a thong?'
p61297
aS'I will if you will.'
p61298
aS'Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!'
p61299
aS"I'm good, I have dinner plans ."
p61300
aS"So you'll be ok?"
p61301
aS"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
p61302
aS'Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?'
p61303
aS'No, why?'
p61304
aS'Oh man!'
p61305
aS"There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!"
p61306
aa(lp61307
S"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!"
p61308
aS"Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David."
p61309
aS'I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".'
p61310
aS"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
p61311
aS'David is going to propose to Phoebe.'
p61312
aS'What?  Why?'
p61313
aS'Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.'
p61314
aS"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
p61315
aS'I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?'
p61316
aS'They\'ve only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She\'ll say "No", David\'s heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.'
p61317
aa(lp61318
S"Man, that's some bad advice!"
p61319
aS'Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!'
p61320
aS"Hey! Hey what's going on?"
p61321
aS'Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!'
p61322
aS"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
p61323
aS'Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!'
p61324
aS"That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!"
p61325
aS"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in"
p61326
aS'Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!'
p61327
aS'Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!'
p61328
aa(lp61329
S"And make sure our room isn't next to theirs ."
p61330
aS"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy."
p61331
aS'Not Joey.'
p61332
aS'Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.'
p61333
aS'Yeah, right!'
p61334
aS"So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight."
p61335
aS"Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!"
p61336
aS"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."
p61337
aS'Nice!'
p61338
aS'Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?'
p61339
aa(lp61340
S'Ok!'
p61341
aS'David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!'
p61342
aS'See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?'
p61343
aS'That would be advice!!'
p61344
aS"Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?"
p61345
aS'Yeah?'
p61346
aS'I need to talk to you.'
p61347
aS'Are you leaving "The Supremes"?'
p61348
aS'Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.'

aS"Wow? Really? That's fantastic!"
p61350
aa(lp61351
S'What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?'
p61352
aS'Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let\'s just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..."  You know, it\'s every girl\'s dream!'
p61353
aS'Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?'
p61354
aS"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!"
p61355

p61366
aS"What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
p61367
aS'Actually the wet season is June to December.'
p61368
aS"It's not the time Charlie."
p61369
aS'Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!'
p61370
aS'Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?'
p61371
aS"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
p61372
aa(lp61373
S'Wha... what do you mean?'
p61374
aS'It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.'
p61375
aS'What, oh my God. What did you do?'
p61376
aS"Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it."
p61377
aS'Why, why would you open it?'
p61378
aS'Well, it didn\'t say "This is a virus"!!'
p61379
aS'What did it say?'
p61380
aS"Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry."
p61381
aS'What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!'
p61382
aS"It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?"
p61383
aa(lp61384
S"NO! I don't!!"
p61385
aS'Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!'
p61386
aS"It's really gone?"
p61387
aS"Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!"
p61388
aS'I just feel awful.'
p61389
aS"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
p61390
aS'Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I\'m gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...'
p61391
aS'Get out!'
p61392
aS'You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.'
p61393
aS'Well, what do you do?'
p61394
aa(lp61395
S"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
p61396
aS"I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?"
p61397
aS'I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.'
p61398
aS"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"
p61399
aS"Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!"
p61400
aS'Wha... what you really think we can do that?'
p61401
aS'Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .'
p61402
aS"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."
p61403
aS'Ugh.'
p61404
aS"Alright, ok, let's do it.  Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."
p61405
aa(lp61406
S'Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .'
p61407
aS'Hello?'
p61408
aS'Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!'
p61409
aS'Who is this?'
p61410
aS'This is Monica! I\'m Phoebe\'s friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he\'s going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!'
p61411
aS"He... he's gonna propose?"
p61412
aS"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!"
p61413
aS"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
p61414
aS"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity?  Damnit!"
p61415
aS"Well, I hope you're happy!"
p61416
aa(lp61417
S"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
p61418
aS'Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that\'s what happens when you meddle in people\'s lives!'
p61419
aS'Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That\'s, that\'s great!'
p61420
aS"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
p61421
aS"And there's not chance that will work?"
p61422
aS"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."
p61423
aS'Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!'
p61424
aS"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
p61425
aS'This vacation sucks!!'
p61426
aS"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
p61427
aa(lp61428
S"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
p61429
aS"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
p61430
aS"Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!"
p61431
aS"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention"
p61432
aS'Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?'
p61433
aS"We can't. We're not pharmacists!"
p61434
aS"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba..."
p61435
aS'Kate Miller?'
p61436
aS'Kate Miller it is.'
p61437
aS"And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend."
p61438
aa(lp61439
S"In that case should I make sure it's on real good?"
p61440
aS'Thank you.'
p61441
aS'And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.'
p61442
aS"Yeah, that's it?"
p61443
aS'Yeah.'
p61444
aS'Oh my God, we did it!'
p61445
aS'Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.'
p61446
aS"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace."
p61447
aS'Thank you.'
p61448
aS'Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?'
p61449
aa(lp61450
S"Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."
p61451
aS'Oh my God, I love you.'
p61452
aS'Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?'
p61453
aS"That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."
p61454
aS'Your first marriage?'
p61455
aS'Yeah.'
p61456
aS"You're married more than once?"
p61457
aS'No.'
p61458
aS'So, why did you break up?'
p61459
aS"Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay."
p61460
aa(lp61461
S'Oh my God, this is so cool!'
p61462
aS'Ok, odd thing to get excited about!'
p61463
aS"No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"
p61464
aS'Hey! High-five!'
p61465
aS"Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fianc\xc3\xa9 was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner."
p61466
aS"My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter."
p61467
aS'Right and then everybody finds out and they\'re like: "Oh, I knew all along"'
p61468
aS'I know! It\'s like, if you knew, why didn\'t you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife\'s gay"'
p61469
aS'I know!'
p61470
aS'And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?'
p61471
aa(lp61472
S"I didn't do that."
p61473
aS'Me neither.'
p61474
aS'Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.'
p61475
aS'I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.'
p61476
aS"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
p61477
aS"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
p61478
aS'But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?'
p61479
aS'No.'
p61480
aS"There it is, you're blushing!"
p61481
aS"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain."
p61482
aa(lp61483
S'You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?'
p61484
aS'No.'
p61485
aS'Tell me who it is.'
p61486
aS'Joey!'
p61487
aS"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?"
p61488
aS"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
p61489
aS'What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?'
p61490
aS'Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?'
p61491
aS'Yeah, who is that?'
p61492
aS'Do ya?'
p61493
aa(lp61494
S'Yeah.'
p61495
aS'Hey!'
p61496
aS"I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."
p61497
aS'Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?'
p61498
aS'Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.'
p61499
aS'I had a great time.'
p61500
aS"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."
p61501
aS'Later! La...'
p61502
aS'So, shall we?'
p61503
aS'Yeah.'
p61504
aa(lp61505
S'Ok. See you, bye.'
p61506
aS'Bye.'
p61507
aS'Good night.'
p61508
aS'Night.'
p61509
aS'Ok, good night!'
p61510
aS"I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike."
p61511
aS"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
p61512
aS'Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.'
p61513
aS"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
p61514
aS'I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!'
p61515
aa(lp61516
S"Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!"
p61517
aS'Sure, ok, yeah.'
p61518
aS"But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end..."
p61519
aS'Oh my God, Mike!'
p61520
aS"It's David, actually!"
p61521
aS"No, Mike's here."
p61522
aS'Hi Mike!'
p61523
aS'Hi David. Chandler. Monica...  Oh!'
p61524
aS"IT'S THE HUMIDITY!"
p61525
aS'Hi Phoebe.'
p61526
aa(lp61527
S'What are you, what are you doing here?'
p61528
aS'I have a question I need to ask you.'
p61529
aS'I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.'
p61530
aS'Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.'
p61531
aS'Ok, would you care for my seat as well?'
p61532
aS"Actually yeah, that'll be great."
p61533
aS"That's fair, you've had a long trip."
p61534
aS'Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.'
p61535
aS'Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.'
p61536
aS'Sorry David, but she really has to know this.'
p61537
aa(lp61538
S'Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.'
p61539
aS"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
p61540
aS'I have a ring.'
p61541
aS"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
p61542
aS'Phoebe, will you marry me?'
p61543
aS'No!'
p61544
aS'Uhm... Ha ha!'
p61545
aS'I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.'
p61546
aS'We can have any future you want.'
p61547
aS"Ok, I'm gonna take off."
p61548
aa(lp61549
S"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
p61550
aS'Just so I know, if I had asked first...'
p61551
aS'Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.'
p61552
aS"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!"
p61553
aS'Is it ok if I hug you now?'
p61554
aS'Yes!'
p61555
aS'BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?'
p61556
aS"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
p61557
aS'I know'
p61558
aS'Open your drapes! Open your drapes!'
p61559
aa(lp61560
S"I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!"
p61561
aS'The sun is out!'
p61562
aS'Hey! Remember when I had corneas?'
p61563
aS"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
p61564
aS"Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes."
p61565
aS'Nooo!'
p61566
aS'Damn it!'
p61567
aS'Walls are pretty thin, guys!'
p61568
aS'Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.'
p61569
aS"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!"
p61570
aa(lp61571
S'Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...'
p61572
aS'Not to mention the cold sores.'
p61573
aS"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
p61574
aS'Really?'
p61575
aS'But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...'
p61576
aS'What?'
p61577
aS'He said "erectus"!'
p61578
aS"You're... you're kidding, right?"
p61579
aS'No, he really said it.'
p61580
aS'... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...'
p61581
aa(lp61582
S'Erectus?'
p61583
aS'Homo.'
p61584
aS'... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you!'
p61585
aS'Oh, thanks guys!'
p61586
aS'I thought... it was wonderful!'
p61587
aS'Oh!'
p61588
aS'Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell.  I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... .'
p61589
aS"Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!"
p61590
aS"All right! Well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?"
p61591
aS'Yeah!'
p61592
aa(lp61593
S'It was really... great!'
p61594
aS'Oh, thank you so much!'
p61595
aS'Yeah, and so funny!'
p61596
aS'Oh!'
p61597
aS"Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys!  Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
p61598
aS"You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!"
p61599
aS"Oh... I'm back!"
p61600
aS'Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?'
p61601
aS'Yeah!'
p61602

p61603
aa(lp61604
S'You were incredible!'
p61605
aS'Yeah?'
p61606
aS'You blew them away!'
p61607
aS"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?"
p61608
aS'I was not!'
p61609
aS"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
p61610
aS"Oh my God!  I'm your groupie!"
p61611
aS"I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!"
p61612
aS'Look, I took it too far!'
p61613
aS"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
p61614
aa(lp61615
S"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  Not you guys. You got it going on!"
p61616
aS'So, what are we gonna do today?'
p61617
aS'They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.'
p61618
aS"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
p61619
aS"I don't think so!"
p61620
aS'Why not?'
p61621
aS"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
p61622
aS"I'm not always that bad!"
p61623
aS'Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?'
p61624
aS'I punched you...?'
p61625
aa(lp61626
S'And...?'
p61627
aS'... Phoebe...?'
p61628
aS'... and...?'
p61629
aS'I clunked your heads together!'
p61630
aS'Hey! There you are!'
p61631
aS'Hey!  As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!'
p61632
aS"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon."
p61633
aS"Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
p61634
aS"You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night..."
p61635
aS"Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech..."
p61636
aa(lp61637
S'Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!'
p61638
aS"Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!"
p61639
aS'Yeah...'
p61640
aS"... is it weird that it's not with each other?"
p61641
aS'Yeah! A little bit, yeah...'
p61642
aS'I think we need to talk...!'
p61643
aS'Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?'
p61644
aS"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
p61645
aS"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!"
p61646

p61647
aa(lp61648

p61655
aS'She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!'

aS'Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.'
p61694
aS"Oh, that's crazy!"
p61695
aS"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
p61696
aS"... yeah, it's true."
p61697
aS'I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!'
p61698
aS'What, hey!'
p61699
aS'Ok, Rach!'
p61700
aS'I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?'
p61701
aS'W-What are you, what are you talking about?'
p61702
aa(lp61703
S"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...  What the hell is my problem? OH!"
p61704
aS"Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl..."
p61705
aS"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
p61706
aS"Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."
p61707
aS'But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?'
p61708
aS'You know? Forget it!'
p61709
aS'No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?'
p61710
aS"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!"
p61711
aS"Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!"

p61715
aS"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
p61716
aS"That's a huge thing!"
p61717
aS"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!"
p61718
aS'What... for how long?'
p61719
aS'Only like a month!'
p61720
aS'A MONTH??'
p61721
aS"What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us!  Ok, dial it up a little!"
p61722
aS'I just have one question!'
p61723
aS'Shoot!'
p61724
aa(lp61725
S"What the hell are you doin'???"
p61726
aS"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?..."
p61727
aS'Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!'
p61728
aS'Who...?'
p61729
aS'CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!'
p61730
aS'Oh yes, of course, I remember him!'
p61731
aS'Yeah, he had a paper route.'
p61732
aS"Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!"
p61733
aS"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
p61734
aS'But can it... just... happen a little bit?'
p61735
aa(lp61736
S"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
p61737
aS'But why, why not?'
p61738
aS"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!  I couldn't do it to Ross!"
p61739
aS"But that wasn't gonna stop you before!"
p61740
aS"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!"
p61741
aS"I'm sorry, too!  OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!"
p61742
aS"NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
p61743

p61750
aS'AAAHHHH!'
p61751
aS"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
p61752
aS'Do you?'
p61753
aS'Ah, yeah!'
p61754
aS'Do you?'
p61755

p61760
aS"Oh, yeah!  Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"
p61761
aS"I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one."
p61762
aS"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"
p61763
aS'Oh, damn it!'
p61764
aS'I sleep with him!'
p61765
aS'Game, point!'
p61766
aS"Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
p61767
aS'You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.'
p61768
aa(lp61769
S'NO, NO, NOOO!'
p61770
aS"And that's how it's done!"
p61771
aS"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
p61772
aS'Best out of three?'
p61773
aS"That's what I'm thinking."
p61774
aS'Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?'
p61775
aS'Serve the ball, chump!'
p61776
aS': Serve the ball, chump.'
p61777
aS'Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.'
p61778
aS"I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!"
p61779
aa(lp61780
S"Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man."
p61781
aS'Jarvis?'
p61782
aS"Oh, you're back...  this is my wife, Nancy."
p61783
aS'Get Out!'
p61784
aS'Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?'
p61785
aS"Yes, please!  So, what's going on?"
p61786
aS'Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.'
p61787
aS'Oh my God, wh-what happened?'
p61788
aS"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
p61789
aS'I knew that was him!'
p61790
aa(lp61791
S"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."
p61792
aS'Hey, you ok?'
p61793
aS'I guess. There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.'
p61794
aS'Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.'
p61795
aS"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
p61796
aS'Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?'
p61797
aS'Or we could throw you both in now!'
p61798
aS"Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!"
p61799
aS"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
p61800
aS'Ok, look! Enough is enough!'
p61801
aa(lp61802
S'No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!'
p61803
aS"Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
p61804
aS"I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!"
p61805
aS'But...'
p61806
aS'Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!'
p61807
aS'What about the obsessive cleaning?'
p61808
aS"That's just good sense!"
p61809
aS'Aww!'
p61810
aS'You ok?'
p61811
aS"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off!  Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh!  Oh my God! I can't play!"
p61812
aa(lp61813
S'So you forfeit?'
p61814
aS'Mike wins?'
p61815
aS"I can't believe it!  I lost!"
p61816
aS"No, you didn't."
p61817
aS'What?'
p61818
aS"Because I'm gonna play for ya."
p61819
aS"You can't do that!"
p61820
aS"Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat."
p61821
aS"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
p61822
aS"Honey, you don't have to do this."
p61823
aa(lp61824
S"Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
p61825
aS'But... you suck!'
p61826
aS"You're welcome, sweetheart."
p61827
aS"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
p61828
aS'Ok!'
p61829
aS"Oh my God! You're good!"
p61830
aS"It's like watching porn!"
p61831
aS"And that's... how... it's done!"
p61832
aS'Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you  Hold on! I almost forgot  loser!  When did you stop sucking?'
p61833
aS"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
p61834
aa(lp61835
S'Why?'
p61836
aS"I don't know."
p61837
aS'This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!'
p61838
aS"That's why!"
p61839
aS'Thanks!'
p61840
aS'Hi.'
p61841
aS'Are they still looking for us?'
p61842
aS'Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.'
p61843
aS"I don't think they saw us."
p61844
aS"I don't think they did."
p61845
aa(lp61846
S'Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.'
p61847
aS'Oh. Can I... can I ask who?'
p61848
aS'I think you know.'
p61849
aS"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
p61850
aS"I'm sorry... we... we can't."
p61851
aS'All right, all right.'
p61852
aS"I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not!"
p61853
aS'What?'
p61854
aS'Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such  a turn-on.You wanna...?'
p61855
aS"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
p61856
aa(lp61857
S"I'll put a pillowcase over my head."
p61858
aS"You're on!"
p61859
aS'Hey!'
p61860
aS"What's up?"
p61861
aS"Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the  way there's  no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you  want..."
p61862
aS'... finally...'
p61863
aS'Is that Ross?'
p61864
aS'Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid  walls.'
p61865
aS"Sounds like he's with someone."
p61866
aS'He could be alone. This morning I heard him do  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.'
p61867
aa(lp61868
S"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I  hear someone else in there with him."
p61869
aS'Ooh... Dr. Geller!'
p61870
aS"God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you  to call me that."
p61871
aS"Oh my God, that's Charlie!"
p61872
aS"She's cheating on Joey with Ross!"
p61873
aS'Oh that tart... floozy... giant...'
p61874
aS"I'm not sure about this."
p61875
aS"Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business."
p61876
aS"No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear  everything. Someone get me a glass!"
p61877
aS"Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop  on my friend."
p61878
aa(lp61879
S'Ooh... I love Barbados!'
p61880
aS"Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm    kissing Rachel!"
p61881

p61882
aS"Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!"
p61883
aS'What?'
p61884
aS'Get over here!'
p61885
aS'ooh...'
p61886
aS'Wow!'
p61887
aS'Oh my God,  I love how thin these walls are!'
p61888
aS'Thank you.'
p61889
aa(lp61890
S'Hey, you know, before you said    that nothing could happen between us? What changed?'
p61891
aS'Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then  I saw him kissing Charlie...'
p61892
aS"What? Ross and Charlie?  Wow! She's really  making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?"
p61893
aS"I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?"
p61894
aS'How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?  No-one is manning that wall!'
p61895
aS"I'm on it!"
p61896
aS'Anything?'
p61897
aS'I think I hear curtains closing...'
p61898
aS"We've got shoes being kicked off over here."
p61899
aS'Bedsprings, unmistakable!'
p61900
aa(lp61901
S"You do realise  that's your brother?"
p61902
aS"Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey  and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the  same person we came with."
p61903
aS"That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving  with Weird Al."
p61904
aS"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,  before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
p61905
aS'Okay Buckwheat!'
p61906
aS"You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free  porn!"
p61907
aS'Weh...*sigh*'
p61908
aS'uhm... Is everything okay?'
p61909
aS"Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this..."
p61910
aS'Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,  because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could  just...'
p61911
aa(lp61912
S"No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.  Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
p61913
aS'I uhm... I completely understand.'
p61914
aS"Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay, I see you later."
p61915
aS'Okay...'
p61916
aS"That's the door. He's gone..."
p61917
aS"And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...  Miss Congeniality!"
p61918
aS'Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it  too well!'
p61919
aS'Hey, what are you guys doing?'
p61920
aS"Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying  goodbye to the hotel.  I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort  and Spa..."
p61921
aS'Yeah, we had a great time, thank  you!'
p61922
aa(lp61923
S'Bye!'
p61924
aS'Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?'
p61925
aS"He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend  Charlie. That's the situation as we know it..."
p61926
aS"Well, if you see him could you please tell  him I'm looking for him?"
p61927
aS'You got it!'
p61928
aS'Thanks!  Thank you!'
p61929
aS'Other wall, people! Other wall!'
p61930
aS'Rach,  you there?'
p61931
aS"Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
p61932
aS"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he  knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!"
p61933
aa(lp61934
S'No idea what it means.'
p61935
aS'Oh... okay, just hide!'
p61936
aS'Rach?'
p61937
aS'Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!'
p61938

p61939
aS'Is everything okay?'
p61940
aS'Yeah...'
p61941
aS'Hey.'
p61942
aS'Hi...'
p61943

p61944
aa(lp61945
S"...I really don't..."
p61946
aS'Can I talk to you for a minute?'
p61947
aS'Yeah, sure...'
p61948
aS"I don't believe this... Have you guys been..."
p61949
aS'Shhh... This is the listening side of the  wall.'
p61950
aS'And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.'
p61951
aS'Uh-huh... right... yeah...'
p61952
aS'And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the  day I met her.'
p61953
aS"Oh, I know... I know it's been  really hard for you."
p61954
aS'Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before  you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna  be?'
p61955
aa(lp61956
S'That is hard to say,  Ross. That is hard to say.'
p61957
aS"You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace."
p61958
aS'You would think!'
p61959
aS'Joey!'
p61960
aS'Is he gone?'
p61961
aS'How are you doing this?'
p61962
aS'Pssst...'
p61963
aS'How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?  Have you guys been listening this entire time?'
p61964
aS'YE-AH!'
p61965
aS'Now, what is this?'
p61966
aa(lp61967
S"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten  minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth  grade!"
p61968
aS'Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated  this could get? What about Ross?'
p61969
aS"Well, he's with Charlie now."
p61970
aS"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything  really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think  he deserves the same from you?"
p61971
aS"You're a pain in  my ass, Geller!"
p61972
aS'All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all  the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...'
p61973
aS"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you  do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?"
p61974
aS'Sure...'
p61975
aS'Enunciate!'
p61976
aS'Get out!'
p61977
aa(lp61978
S'Are they right?'
p61979
aS'Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off  until we talk to Ross.'
p61980
aS"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have  to do anything tonight."
p61981
aS"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...  I'm gonna take off..."
p61982
aS'Although...'
p61983
aS'I like although!'
p61984
aS"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...  six years..."
p61985
aS"Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool..."
p61986
aS'Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.'
p61987
aS"Absolutely! He's not thinking about you."
p61988
aa(lp61989

p61995
aS'Nothing...'
p61996

p62009
aS"Dude! You're not taking your Bible?"
p62010
aa(lp62011

p62013
aS'Hey!'
p62014
aS'So, did you talk to Joey?'
p62015

p62026
aS'Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!'
p62027
aS'What do you think?'
p62028
aS'I think.... I think I can see your scalp.'
p62029
aS"Don't you just love it?"
p62030
aS'Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.'
p62031
aS"It's so... something... You go girlfriend!"
p62032
aa(lp62033
S"You've never said that in your life, have you?"
p62034
aS'Not once.'
p62035
aS'I thought so.'
p62036
aS'And listen to this...'
p62037
aS"What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the  ears."
p62038
aS"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting  next to Charlie after we broke up."
p62039
aS"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care  about your social life."
p62040
aS'Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?'
p62041
aS'Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference  with Charlie.'
p62042
aS'I understand...'
p62043
aa(lp62044
S"No, I'll do it."
p62045
aS"Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't  wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there."
p62046
aS"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain  turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
p62047
aS"You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,  'cause items may shift during..."
p62048
aS"Aaah... you're not good at this..."
p62049
aS"You don't have to go home tonight, do you?"
p62050

p62051
aS'Oh...'
p62052
aS'What?'
p62053
aS"Uhm... I can't do anything tonight."
p62054
aa(lp62055
S'Why not?'
p62056
aS'I have a date.'
p62057
aS'You have a... You have a date? With who?'
p62058
aS"Oh, it's... my girlfriend."
p62059
aS'You have...  have a girlfriend?'
p62060
aS'Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started  seeing someone.'
p62061
aS'For how long?'
p62062
aS'Three months.'
p62063
aS"Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my  business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
p62064
aS"I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I  promise."
p62065
aa(lp62066
S"Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you  get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
p62067
aS"Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the  packing material..."
p62068
aS"You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave  it there."
p62069
aS'Right, I\'m gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the  right time. He\'s always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty  free".'
p62070
aS'Okay... Good luck.'
p62071
aS'Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really  good time to talk to him.'
p62072
aS"I guess so. I'm just... really nervous."
p62073
aS"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,  they'll probably be serving dinner."
p62074
aS'Ooh...'
p62075
aS'Still nervous?'
p62076
aa(lp62077
S"I'm gonna get the lasagna."
p62078
aS'Hey Rach...'
p62079
aS'Yeah!'
p62080

p62081
aS'Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!'
p62082
aS'Hey!'
p62083
aS'Hey!'
p62084
aS'So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.'
p62085
aS'Yeah?'
p62086
aS'Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry  to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,  well...'
p62087
aa(lp62088
S'You kissed.'
p62089
aS'Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?'
p62090
aS'I saw you.'
p62091
aS'Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else  happened, okay.'
p62092
aS"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
p62093
aS'What?'
p62094
aS"It's okay. You know, I totally understand,  alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...  I want you to be happy."
p62095
aS'Are you serious?'
p62096
aS'Yeah... Now I have something...'
p62097
aS"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put  my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know  that?"
p62098
aa(lp62099
S'Oh... uh...  look... before you...'
p62100
aS'No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,  and generous...'
p62101
aS'I am those things, yeah.'
p62102
aS'You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always  think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some  stuff...'
p62103
aS'Dude!'
p62104
aS'Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...'
p62105
aS"I can't think of anything."
p62106
aS'Thanks!'
p62107
aS'Yeah.'
p62108
aS'So hi!'
p62109
aa(lp62110
S'Hi!'
p62111
aS'So you eh, you talked to Joey?'
p62112
aS'Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.'
p62113
aS"Oh! That's great!"
p62114
aS'Yeah!'
p62115
aS"Oh, so everything's okay?"
p62116
aS"Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing  guy."
p62117
aS'Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.'
p62118
aS"Well, I'm so excited about this."
p62119
aS'Really? Excited?'
p62120
aa(lp62121
S'Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams  about this...'
p62122
aS"Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?"
p62123
aS"I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things  about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge  on Chandler."
p62124
aS'Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget  it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.'
p62125
aS'Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.'
p62126
aS"Hi, Mike's place."
p62127
aS"Hey, it's Mike."
p62128
aS'Ooh, that was fast.'
p62129
aS"Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think  I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone..."
p62130
aS"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap  on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,  women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.  Just F.Y.I."
p62131
aa(lp62132
S'One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious  on my coffee table.'
p62133
aS'Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you  pick her up at the pound?'
p62134
aS'Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.'
p62135
aS'Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch  her tummy and give her a liver snout.'
p62136
aS"Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?"
p62137
aS"I... I'm Phoebe."
p62138
aS"Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of  his life? That Phoebe?"
p62139
aS'Enchant\xc3\xa9'
p62140
aS"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...   Ow!"
p62141
aS'You go back to work tomorrow night, right?'
p62142
aa(lp62143
S'Yeah!'
p62144
aS"So if you want people to see them, then by definition  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
p62145
aS"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be  able to do this.  You like that, right?"
p62146
aS'What are you singing?'
p62147
aS'It\'s "Bolero" from "10".'
p62148
aS'It\'s "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse  Now"...  See, here\'s the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy  hair problem. And now that we\'re home, we don\'t have that problem anymore,  so if you think about it... I hate them!'
p62149
aS'You what? You said you liked them.'
p62150
aS"Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was  that I could see your scalp."
p62151
aS"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does."
p62152
aS"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...  Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
p62153
aa(lp62154
S"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...   OUCH!"
p62155
aS'Hit yourself in the tooth?'
p62156
aS'And the eye!'
p62157
aS'Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed  you.  Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have  a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants  again to use as a rattle?'
p62158
aS'That was one time, Ross, and they were only like  5 milligrams.'
p62159
aS'Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?  Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.'
p62160
aS"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really  need to talk to you about."
p62161
aS'Okay, shoot!'
p62162
aS"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
p62163
aS'OH NO!'
p62164
aa(lp62165
S'What? What is it?'
p62166
aS'Oh, major shampoo explosion!'
p62167
aS"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy."
p62168
aS"Oh, it's all over everything. Why?  Why me?"
p62169
aS'Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?'
p62170
aS"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?"
p62171
aS"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and..."
p62172
aS"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.  It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?"
p62173
aS'Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.'
p62174
aS'Duh, you think?'
p62175
aa(lp62176
S"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,  you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at  the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.  Point is... I'm gonna take off."
p62177
aS"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's  going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?"
p62178
aS'Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?'
p62179
aS'My name is Precious.'
p62180
aS"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be  straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately  that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about  that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
p62181
aS"I just can't believe this... Why?"
p62182
aS"Well, I don't..."
p62183
aS"Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong  with me?"
p62184
aS"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
p62185
aS'I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?'
p62186
aa(lp62187
S'Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have    some pride, for the love of God.'
p62188
aS'Okay, not a fan of the tough love.'
p62189
aS"I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any  warning."
p62190
aS"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning  on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
p62191
aS'He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  ever.'
p62192
aS"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this.  You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a  wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna  break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
p62193
aS"Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need  him. I deserve to be treated with respect."
p62194
aS"Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard,  and I hope you rot in hell."
p62195
aS"You're welcome!"
p62196
aS"Honey, you've been in there for a long time...  Is everything okay?"
p62197
aa(lp62198
S'Not really.'
p62199
aS'I have a problem.'
p62200
aS'Really? What happened?'
p62201
aS'Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman,  No Cry" and I got stuck.'
p62202
aS"You can't move at all?"
p62203
aS'Oh, well, I can move...'
p62204
aS'If I untangle you, will you please get rid of thecorn rose?'
p62205
aS'I guess so...'
p62206
aS'Some of these look a little  frayed.'
p62207
aS'Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.'
p62208
aa(lp62209
S'Hey!'
p62210
aS'Hi!'
p62211
aS'So, did you err... did you tell Ross?'
p62212
aS"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related  emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again."
p62213
aS"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better  if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if  he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory."
p62214
aS"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do."
p62215
aS"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how  about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
p62216
aS"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again  we can't..."
p62217
aS"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can  control ourselves, we're not animals."
p62218
aS'No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that  means good night then?'
p62219
aa(lp62220
S'Yeah! Good night!'
p62221
aS'Goo--ood night!'
p62222
aS'Good night!'
p62223
aS'Seriously, good night!'
p62224
aS'Stop saying good night.'
p62225
aS'Okay.'
p62226
aS"Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this..."
p62227
aS"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a  little something for me?"
p62228
aS'Sure, what do you have in mind?'
p62229
aS'I think you know.'
p62230
aa(lp62231
S"Really? I don't really feel like it."
p62232
aS'This is what I want to do.'
p62233
aS"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."
p62234
aS"She's an  FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
p62235
aS"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
p62236
aS"We weren't doing anything!"
p62237
aS'Rach, he just saw us.'
p62238
aS'Shhh.'
p62239
aS'But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.'
p62240
aS'No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.'
p62241
aa(lp62242
S"Dude, chill!  Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados,but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was becauseI saw you kissing Charlie."
p62243
aS"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill."
p62244
aS'Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..'
p62245
aS'We feel so terrible about this, Ross.'
p62246
aS'Yeah, but it did happen, so...'
p62247
aS'Ross?'
p62248
aS'Ross?  Can we just close the door?'
p62249
aS'Ross, say something. Anything.'
p62250
aS'So you two are..?'
p62251
aS'Yeah.'
p62252
aa(lp62253
S'And have you .. ed?'
p62254
aS'No, no, no!'
p62255
aS'No, no, no!'
p62256

p62257
aS'Probably.'
p62258
aS'No, no!'
p62259
aS'Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.'
p62260
aS"I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?"
p62261
aS'No, but you know what I mean.'
p62262
aS"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.   I'm fine!"
p62263
aa(lp62264
S'Really?'
p62265
aS"Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why  it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,   I'm fine.  I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean,at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin'this."
p62266
aS'Ross..'
p62267
aS"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what  we should do?"
p62268
aS'Calm ourselves?'
p62269
aS"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.  I'll cook!!"
p62270
aS"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
p62271
aS"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if  someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!"
p62272
aS'I do like fajitas.'
p62273
aS"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's  inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways  to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."

p62276

p62277
aS'Hey.'
p62278
aS"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with  the triplets."
p62279
aS'You know, it\'s funny. Every time you say "triplets," I  immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.'
p62280
aS"That's sweet. Drink your hair."
p62281
aS"Hey, what's all this stuff?"
p62282
aS"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
p62283
aS'Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!'
p62284
aS"That's not really how it works."
p62285
aa(lp62286
S'Oh, how does it work?'
p62287
aS"I don't know!"
p62288
aS"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my  friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help  you."
p62289
aS"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be  great?"
p62290
aS"Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.  When we're in a public place, there are certain rules."
p62291
aS"That's not what we talked about!!"
p62292
aS'Hey!'

p62299
aS"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
p62300
aS'Which one is which again?'
p62301
aS"Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the  lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's  Leslie throwing bagels at him."
p62302
aS'"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!'
p62303
aS"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's  cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our  first date."
p62304
aS'Well, what would we be doing?'
p62305
aS"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy  dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
p62306
aS'Feel me up?'
p62307
aa(lp62308
S'In a carriage!'
p62309

p62312
aS'Oh, you bet.'
p62313
aS'So, did you bring a little something for Ross?'
p62314
aS"Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment."
p62315
aS'Oh. Oh, thanks.'
p62316
aS'And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you  want.'
p62317
aS"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.."
p62318
aa(lp62319
S"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.   And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new  girlfriend.  I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know.  Come, please come in. Come in."
p62320
aS'Okay, well, we brought you some wine.'
p62321
aS"Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what  did you bring me?"
p62322
aS"Uh, actually, that's.."
p62323
aS'Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these  things!!'
p62324
aS'Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...'
p62325
aS"What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?  You see? Who else is fine?"
p62326
aS"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe  have a drink."
p62327
aS"You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a  pitcher of Margaritas."
p62328

aS'Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest  thing..'
p62334
aS"I haven't slept in four years!"
p62335
aS"That's a, that's a long time."
p62336
aS"You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so  many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold  one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with  his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's  three of them, Phoebe, three!"
p62337
aS'Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out  of my area.'
p62338
aS"Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,  it's too horrible. No."
p62339
aS'What?'
p62340
aa(lp62341
S"No, I can't."
p62342
aS"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I  didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
p62343
aS'Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking  that, you know, maybe you could take one.'
p62344
aS"What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?"
p62345
aS'Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great  things about you guys.'
p62346
aS"Oh, please, we're happy to help."
p62347
aS'We went through the same thing when we were adopting.'
p62348
aS'So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this  room, huh?'
p62349
aS'I mean, you have a lovely home.'
p62350
aS'Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.'
p62351
aa(lp62352
S'Well, actually, I think this might help.'
p62353
aS"It's pretty much all the information you need."
p62354
aS'Oh my god!'
p62355
aS'Everything is broken down into categories, and then  cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms  in the back.'
p62356
aS'Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.'
p62357
aS"I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.  Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us."
p62358
aS"That's great.  Can I see the book?"
p62359
aS"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
p62360
aS"It's.. It's just so pretty and white."
p62361
aS'The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.'
p62362
aa(lp62363
S'I would have told him to do it too.'
p62364
aS'Can I adopt you?'
p62365
aS'Hey, you must be Owen.'
p62366
aS'Yeah.'
p62367
aS"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too."
p62368
aS'You were?'
p62369
aS'Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.'
p62370
aS'Huh?'
p62371
aS'You know how to use a compass?'
p62372
aS'I have a badge in it.'
p62373
aa(lp62374
S"You do? That's fantastic!"
p62375
aS'You wanna see it?'
p62376
aS"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your  parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you."
p62377
aS'What?!?'
p62378
aS'What?'
p62379
aS"I'm adopted?"
p62380
aS'I got nothing.'
p62381
aS'The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second  batch is gooooood.'
p62382
aS'Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.'
p62383
aS"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.  Just hangin'."
p62384
aa(lp62385
S'Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?'
p62386
aS"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.  There's no weirdness, no tension."
p62387
aS'No awareness.'
p62388
aS"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!  Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
p62389
aS'My fajitas!!'
p62390
aS"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a  little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he  normally doesn't drink like this."
p62391
aS'Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging  alcoholic.'
p62392
aS"Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?"
p62393
aS'Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!'
p62394
aS"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
p62395
aa(lp62396
S'That is gonna hurt tomorrow!'
p62397
aS"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me  taking one of your kids, can we?"
p62398
aS"No, of course we're not."
p62399
aS'Insane.'
p62400
aS'I know.'
p62401
aS'Alice would never go for it, right?'
p62402
aS"Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've  got her onboard."
p62403
aS"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,  hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?"
p62404
aS'Huh.'
p62405
aS'Frank Jr.Jr.?'
p62406
aa(lp62407
S"Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,  he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke."
p62408
aS'Uh-huh.'
p62409
aS'What\'s green and says "hey, I\'m a frog"? A talking frog!   Oh, no, you can\'t have him, he\'s too funny.'
p62410
aS"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?"
p62411
aS"Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that  knows how to burp the alphabet."
p62412
aS'Alright, so that leaves Chandler.'
p62413
aS"Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my  little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a  realtor.."
p62414
aS'Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.'
p62415
aS"Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I  can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but  they're my babies."
p62416
aS"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You  know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You  name the day, and I'll be there."
p62417
aa(lp62418
S'How about tomorrow?'
p62419
aS"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff  around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day  together."
p62420
aS"You'd do that for us?"
p62421
aS"Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for."
p62422
aS"Look at them! Aw. I love you so  much.  Oh crap, don't  wake up, don't wake up!"
p62423
aS'Where are Bill and Colleen?'
p62424
aS"They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you  believe how nice they are?"
p62425
aS'We have to leave!!'
p62426
aS'Why? What did you do in the bathroom?'
p62427
aS"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,  and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may  have told him."
p62428
aa(lp62429
S"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace  everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!"
p62430
aS'Hey.'
p62431
aS"Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the  sour worms. Those are for Owen."
p62432
aS"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we  haven't told him he's adopted yet."
p62433
aS"But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he  already knows?"
p62434
aS"I'm adopted?!"
p62435
aS'See? Intuitive!'
p62436
aS'What? Where did you hear that?'
p62437
aS'He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.'
p62438
aS'Which technically now you should give back!'
p62439
aa(lp62440
S"You told him he's adopted?"
p62441
aS'I\'m so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or  something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the  door. "Owen doesn\'t know he\'s adopted, and he also thinks that Santa  is real."'
p62442
aS"He isn't?!"
p62443
aS'We have to get out of here, baby!'
p62444
aS'Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.'
p62445
aS'Ooy.'
p62446
aS'And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is  life without love?'
p62447
aS'Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?'
p62448
aS'O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn  of  events, which I\'m still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely  normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might  get married and have children of your own.'
p62449
aS'Dude, are you okay?'
p62450
aa(lp62451
S'Totally.'
p62452
aS"Ross, you don't seem okay."
p62453
aS"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of  entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan."
p62454
aS'Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.'
p62455
aS'No!'
p62456
aS"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but  this has been lovely."
p62457
aS"Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and  that you never really liked Rachel."
p62458
aS"You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?"
p62459
aS'Okay.'
p62460
aS'Alright.'
p62461
aa(lp62462
S'God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..'
p62463
aS"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
p62464
aS'Bye.'
p62465
aS"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!"
p62466
aS"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too."
p62467
aS"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple  now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone."
p62468
aS"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
p62469
aS"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of  margaritas. It's all good."
p62470
aS"I don't even know what that's for."
p62471
aS"You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's  okay."
p62472
aa(lp62473
S"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
p62474
aS"Yeah. I'll see you in the morning."
p62475
aS"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever  gonna be okay with this."
p62476
aS"It doesn't look good, does it?"
p62477
aS'Morning. Here you go.'
p62478
aS'Thanks. Did you stay here all night?'
p62479
aS'Yeah.'
p62480
aS'So you took off my pants and shoes?'
p62481
aS"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the  Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you  don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
p62482
aS'What do you mean?'
p62483
aa(lp62484
S"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do  anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
p62485
aS"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!"
p62486
aS"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're  not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
p62487
aS"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six  years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?"
p62488
aS"That's what I hear, yeah."
p62489
aS"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys  aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is  this thing with you and Rachel?"
p62490
aS'Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...'
p62491
aS'Joey.'
p62492
aS"I'm crazy about her."
p62493
aS'And she feels the same way?'
p62494
aa(lp62495
S'I think so.'
p62496
aS"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
p62497
aS"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
p62498
aS"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,  right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't  see the dance, did she?"
p62499
aS'No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure  about this?'
p62500
aS"Yeah, I'm sure."
p62501
aS"And we're okay?"
p62502
aS'Hey, Phoebs'
p62503
aS'Hey.'
p62504
aS'Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate  us.'
p62505
aa(lp62506
S"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
p62507
aS'What?'
p62508
aS'Still, he had to find out sometime.'
p62509
aS'Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets  that you gave birth to them?'
p62510
aS"I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident."
p62511
aS'So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?'
p62512
aS"Yeah. It's actually our first official date"
p62513
aS"Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?"
p62514
aS"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
p62515
aS'What must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing.'
p62516
aa(lp62517
S"It's OK!"
p62518
aS'How can you be so confident?'
p62519
aS"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
p62520
aS'Really? Like you have a routine?'
p62521
aS'No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have  to appreciate their uniqueness.'
p62522
aS'Really?'
p62523
aS'No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.'
p62524
aS'You mean like this?'
p62525
aS'NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.'
p62526

aS'Why...why?'
p62542
aS"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
p62543
aS'Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off.'
p62544
aS'So, do you get colours or just French tips?'
p62545

p62546

p62553
aS"Who's Amanda?"
p62554
aS'She\'s this girl who used to live  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It\'s Amanda calling!"'
p62555
aS'Are you trying to do a British accent?'
p62556

p62564
aS'What?'
p62565
aS"Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and  dodge her 'till she gets the point!"
p62566
aS'Oh, I guess we could try that, but...  it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?'
p62567
aS'No, had it done to me though. Feels good !'

aS'Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.'

aS'Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?'
p62632
aS'Ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s work from the top down!  Just work the bra, Joe!'
p62633
aS'Ok, yeah, got it.'
p62634
aS'Okay.'
p62635
aS'This thing welded shut?!'
p62636
aS'Okay.'
p62637
aa(lp62638
S'All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this  thing.'
p62639
aS'Oh!'
p62640
aS'Ow!'
p62641
aS'Sorry!'
p62642
aS'Well this is romantic!'
p62643
aS"I'm sorry!  This never happened to me  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!  I blame your bra!"
p62644
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a standard issue bra clasp!'
p62645
aS"Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me  off with all your slapping!"
p62646
aS"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take  off my bra?"
p62647
aS"NAH! I don't have another level!!"
p62648
aa(lp62649
S'Hold on! There is something different.'
p62650
aS'I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.'
p62651
aS'Was that place... The Sun?'
p62652
aS'Oh! And it gets worse!'
p62653
aS'Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory  all by yourself!'
p62654
aS"How could you mess this up? It's  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
p62655
aS'How do you count to five?'
p62656
aS'One Two Three...'
p62657
aS'Damnit!'
p62658
aS'oooh! Oh oh!'
p62659
aa(lp62660
S'I Know!'
p62661
aS'oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?'
p62662
aS'How was your date with Joey?'
p62663
aS'Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  I kept slapping it away!'
p62664
aS"You didn't like that?"
p62665
aS"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!"
p62666
aS'Wow, really? One time he just looked  at my bra and it popped open.'
p62667
aS"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me."
p62668
aS"Well, you guys have been friends  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that."
p62669
aS"Ok, that's true. That's true,  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna  power through!"
p62670
aa(lp62671
S'Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .'
p62672
aS'No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through  .'
p62673
aS'Chandler,  stop! It is not going to pop open!'
p62674
aS"You don't  know!"
p62675
aS'Hey Phoebe!'
p62676
aS'Hey!'
p62677
aS'Is Amanda here yet?'
p62678
aS'No.'
p62679
aS"Oh good. Good, look  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
p62680
aS'Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both  out of here?'
p62681
aa(lp62682
S'Well, what do you think of Mike  and Chandler being in a car accident?'
p62683
aS'Are you kidding, I love it!'
p62684
aS'Hi!'
p62685
aS'Hi!'
p62686
aS'Hi!'
p62687
aS'Hello!'
p62688
aS"It's so nice to see you!  Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look!  Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch  my abs  I don't exercise at all!  Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!"
p62689
aS'Yeah! Yeah! His name is  Chandler and...'
p62690
aS"Smell my neck!  It's  not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!"
p62691
aS'Musty!'
p62692
aa(lp62693
S"Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like  old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!"
p62694
aS'When were we not friends?'
p62695
aS'Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was  the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .'
p62696
aS'Ehm, we were friends in 1992.'
p62697
aS'No I distinctly remember you were dodging  her  calls and trying to avoid seeing her.'
p62698
aS'You were going to cut  me out?'
p62699
aS'Well...kinda.'
p62700
aS'Oh My God!'
p62701
aS'Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like  a perfect arse!'
p62702
aS'Yeah well, in America you\'re just an "ass".'
p62703
aa(lp62704
S"Hello? Chandler,  what's wrong?  Oh my God, are you alright?   Yeah, I'll be right there.  I'm so sorry,  but Chandler was in a car accident."
p62705
aS'Oh my  God. Was Mike with him?'
p62706
aS'Nope!'
p62707
aS'Hey!'
p62708
aS'Hey! Got champagne?'
p62709
aS"Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"

p62711
aS'Uh!'
p62712
aS'Ok  Sexy, sexy, very  sexy, sexy.  Alright!  Lets do it!'
p62713
aS"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
p62714
aa(lp62715
S"Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like  that huh?"
p62716
aS'Oh! yeah!'
p62717
aS"You like that?  Let's take this into high gear"
p62718
aS'uh uh!'
p62719
aS"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
p62720
aS'No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!'
p62721
aS"What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?"
p62722
aS'Soldier down!'
p62723
aS'We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.'
p62724
aS'If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!'
p62725
aa(lp62726
S"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can  I talk to you outside for a minute?"
p62727
aS'I have nothing to say to  you.'
p62728
aS'Wow,  my flat is twice this size!'
p62729
aS'Please, Monica? In the hall?'
p62730
aS'Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look  positively ghastly.'
p62731
aS"Well, aren't you a treat."
p62732
aS"I can't believe you tried to cut  me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
p62733
aS'It was right after we were living together and you  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and  shrill.'
p62734
aS"I'm still all those things!"
p62735
aS"You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!"
p62736
aa(lp62737
S'I am scrappy.'
p62738
aS"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only  one who ever clawed her way back in."
p62739
aS"It's because I'm scrappy."
p62740
aS"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
p62741
aS"I won't know what I would do without  you."
p62742
aS'Well, I guess we should go back  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.'
p62743
aS"Yeah, I guess you're right."
p62744
aS"Can you believe it. I've never had any professional  dance training."
p62745
aS'Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the  booth, and...'
p62746
aS"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them  all on my back."
p62747
aa(lp62748
S'Okay...'
p62749
aS"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one  is it?"
p62750
aS'Which... which... which... Which one is it?'
p62751
aS'OH! SON OF A BITCH!'
p62752
aS'What is the matter with us?'
p62753
aS"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
p62754
aS'No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed  to be this... difficult?'
p62755
aS"I don't know."
p62756
aS'That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... Hey!'
p62757
aS'Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more  than that?'
p62758
aa(lp62759
S'Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide  from you guys...'
p62760
aS'No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...'
p62761
aS'Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?'
p62762
aS"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
p62763
aS"I can tell from your expressions that that's the  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the  joy."
p62764
aS"Well, just because it happened that way for them  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
p62765
aS"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's  difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
p62766
aS'Right, totally.'
p62767
aS'Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...  do it.'
p62768
aS"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one  of those couples that never have sex."
p62769
aa(lp62770
S"That's a... pla-an."
p62771
aS'Wow... I did not see this coming.'
p62772
aS'I know.'
p62773
aS"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what  I wanted."
p62774
aS'Hmmm... Me too...'
p62775
aS'I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?'
p62776
aS"I guess they weren't as good friends as we are."
p62777
aS"Aah... I bet you're right."
p62778
aS'So...'
p62779
aS'Yeah.'
p62780
aa(lp62781
S'I love ya.'
p62782
aS"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed."
p62783
aS'Yeah, me too.'
p62784
aS"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while."
p62785
aS"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
p62786
aS"Go away! I don't want to see anybody."
p62787
aS'I know, I went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.'
p62788
aS'Really? Did you count Mississipily?'
p62789
aS"Dude, you're not tanned."
p62790
aS'No, I just had to get a picture of this.'
p62791
aa(lp62792
S'I see you later!'
p62793
aS'Hey guys!'
p62794
aS'Hey!'
p62795
aS'Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.'
p62796
aS'That place in Vermont? You can  take  a hint!'
p62797
aS"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!"
p62798
aS'Yeah!'
p62799
aS"We're having a party."
p62800
aS"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?"
p62801
aS'No.'
p62802
aa(lp62803
S"No,   that day... that won't be her real birthday!"
p62804
aS'Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday   was!'
p62805
aS"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us."
p62806
aS"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.   You know, to reconnect... emotionally."
p62807
aS"There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim..."
p62808
aS"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?"
p62809
aS'Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing   weird sex stuff to my little sister.'
p62810
aS'And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can   we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!'
p62811
aS"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party."
p62812
aS'Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this   party...'
p62813
aa(lp62814
S"Believe me, that is not why we won't   be doing that!"
p62815
aS"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would   hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure   map to help me find 'em all."
p62816
aS'Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...   when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood   to buy us food!'
p62817
aS'Hey guys!'
p62818
aS'Hi!'
p62819
aS"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video."
p62820
aS"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma   and we'll give it to her when she is 18."
p62821
aS"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!"
p62822
aS'Yeah!'
p62823
aS"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't   even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And   they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant   people!"
p62824
aa(lp62825
S"That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?"
p62826
aS"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon."
p62827
aS'Ah, and where is Joey?'
p62828
aS"I said it's still nap time."
p62829
aS'Hey, there is uncle Joey!'
p62830
aS'Hey!'
p62831
aS'Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!'
p62832
aS'18, uh?'
p62833
aS'Joey, NO!'
p62834
aS"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!"
p62835
aa(lp62836
S"When they see this you'll be 52!"
p62837
aS'And starting to think about settling down!'
p62838
aS"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents   on?"
p62839
aS"I'd love to! Yeah!"
p62840
aS'We were supposed to bring presents?'
p62841
aS'Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.'
p62842
aS'Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?'
p62843
aS"Joey, it's a birthday party."
p62844
aS'Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What\'s the point... the other day she laughed   for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as   a farmer. And he\'s standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!    Yeah... that\'s a funny cup!'
p62845
aS'Hey!'
p62846
aa(lp62847
S"Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?"
p62848
aS"Oh, she's still napping"
p62849
aS'Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party   she knows is happening.'
p62850
aS"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't   a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a   first birthday again."
p62851
aS"All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and   get the fun time started!"
p62852
aS"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up."
p62853
aS'Are you freaking kidding me, Green?'
p62854
aS'HI!'
p62855
aS'Hey!'
p62856
aS'So glad you came!'
p62857
aa(lp62858
S"I can't believe Emma is already one!"
p62859
aS'I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the   attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to   take him to the emergency room!'
p62860
aS"There's something you didn't know   about your dad!"
p62861
aS'Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.'
p62862
aS'Thank you!'
p62863
aS'Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what   would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!'
p62864
aS'Which one are you?'
p62865
aS"I can't believe Emma is still asleep!"
p62866
aS'I know, what are we gonna do?'
p62867
aS"I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really   hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!"
p62868
aa(lp62869
S"I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!"
p62870
aS'Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,   maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!'
p62871
aS'So you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna... hit on her?'
p62872
aS'No, no, no! My talents as an actor!'
p62873
aS'Oh!'
p62874
aS'You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one   of her books!'
p62875
aS'Or you could stick a fork in an apple!'
p62876
aS'Hey, I think Emma might like it!'
p62877
aS'Oh! Emma might like what?'
p62878
aS'Um, my present!'
p62879
aa(lp62880
S'What did you get her?'
p62881
aS'Actually we prepared performances.'
p62882
aS'Separate performances.'
p62883
aS'But equally real!'
p62884
aS'Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are   getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind   performing them once now?'
p62885
aS'Sure, yeah!'
p62886
aS'O K.'
p62887
aS'All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this party started, huh?   Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.'
p62888
aS'Oh, great!'
p62889
aS'Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing   prepared?'
p62890
aa(lp62891
S'Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole   crew waiting!'
p62892
aS'So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?'
p62893
aS'I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s books.'
p62894
aS'Oh, ok, which one?'
p62895
aS"Uh, why, it\xe2\x80\x99s a...  one of her favorites, uh,    \xe2\x80\x9cRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum   depression\xe2\x80\x9d eesh!  \xe2\x80\x9cLove   you forever\xe2\x80\x9d.

'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!   Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy   birthday Emma!"
p62903
aS'Is that it?'
p62904
aS'No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . \xe2\x80\x9cSex and the single mother.  Finding your G-spot.'

p62908

aS'Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different   shapes, and if you give them a photo, they\xe2\x80\x99ll copy it in icing!'
p62920
aS'Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?'
p62921
aS'Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.'
p62922
aS'Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say   for bachelorette parties?'
p62923
aa(lp62924
S'Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God!   They put my baby\xe2\x80\x99s face on a penis!'
p62925
aS'oh! Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a party!'
p62926
aS"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to   be a disaster I would have baked it myself!"
p62927
aS'Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?'
p62928
aS'Jack, look at this.'
p62929
aS"I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!"
p62930
aS'I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.'
p62931
aS'No, no, this is not what I ordered.   Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for   my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!'
p62932
aS'Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby\xe2\x80\x99s face off the   penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!'
p62933
aS"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even   want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!"
p62934
aa(lp62935
S"I'm so confused!"
p62936
aS'Yes, yes. I still want   my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with   nuts!'
p62937
aS'To be fair this one does have nuts.'
p62938
aS'Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could   go and get the cake.'
p62939
aS"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!"
p62940
aS"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message   to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!"
p62941
aS"Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?"
p62942
aS"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"
p62943
aS'We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together   and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.'
p62944
aS'Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to   go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in   a half hour.'
p62945
aa(lp62946
S'And you know, I have a massage client soon.'
p62947
aS'You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be   back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?'
p62948
aS'Alright, 5 more minutes.'
p62949
aS"Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right   there."
p62950
aS'Was that Emma? Is she up?'
p62951
aS'No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot   her licence so now I have to bring it to her.'
p62952
aS"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonnago."
p62953
aS"No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us    We've been complaining the longest!"
p62954
aS"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad   that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes   back here and all you guys are gone?"
p62955
aS"I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!"
p62956
aa(lp62957
S"Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!"
p62958
aS"Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you're going?"
p62959
aS'To the bathroom!'
p62960
aS"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna   be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!"
p62961
aS"Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!"
p62962
aS'What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!'
p62963
aS"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it."
p62964
aS'No, it did not.'
p62965
aS'No.'
p62966
aS"Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at   night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane."
p62967
aa(lp62968
S'Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger   scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.'
p62969

p62970
aS'Ok!'
p62971
aS'Bye... Bye dear.'
p62972

p62973
aS'Nighty-night!'
p62974
aS'Bye, bye.'
p62975
aS'Joey? How could you just let them leave?'
p62976
aS"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he   fought for our country."
p62977
aS"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea."
p62978
aa(lp62979
S"Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you   guys in."
p62980

p62981
aS'Oh! I forgot you used to live here!'
p62982
aS'Hello?'
p62983
aS"Joey! It's Estelle!"
p62984
aS'Hey!'
p62985
aS'So, how did your audition go today?'
p62986
aS'What audition?'
p62987
aS'The one I told you about last week?'
p62988
aS'What? You never said anything about an audition!'
p62989
aa(lp62990
S"Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.   I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to   have a monologue prepared."
p62991
aS"A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.     Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!"
p62992
aS"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client   waiting outside my door any minute!"
p62993
aS"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right   now!"
p62994
aS'Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as   the person who realized that, I get to go!'
p62995
aS"No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying."
p62996
aS'Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever   gets the highest number gets to go first.'
p62997
aS'Ok, ten.'
p62998
aS'Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?'
p62999
aS'No, lets just draw straws.'
p63000
aa(lp63001
S'Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..'
p63002
aS"I'm begging you stop."
p63003
aS'Right.'
p63004
aS'Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday.   We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!'
p63005
aS"Yeah!! Let's do that!"
p63006
aS'That sounds more fun than the thing we were going   to do in Vermont!'
p63007
aS'Everybody get your toys!'
p63008
aS'Ok! I want the dolphin!'
p63009
aS'Thats a bear.'
p63010
aS"I'm too excited!"
p63011
aa(lp63012
S'Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler   and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes   in last, stays!'
p63013
aS'Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!'
p63014
aS'Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!'
p63015
aS'Go! Go!'
p63016
aS'Come on robot!'
p63017
aS'What are you barking at?'
p63018
aS'Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?'
p63019
aS"I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?"
p63020
aS'Way to go robot!'
p63021
aS'Good job Alan!'
p63022
aa(lp63023
S'Hey, good race you guys.'
p63024
aS'Yeah, see you later!'
p63025
aS"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly   stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog   never crossed the finish line, so technically..."
p63026
aS'They left.'
p63027
aS"No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just   gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna   be there as soon as we can.  Bye..."
p63028
aS'RACHEL!'
p63029
aS'OOH! God! Sorry!'
p63030
aS"I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a   good driver."
p63031
aS"Emma's awake."
p63032
aS'Yeah?'
p63033
aa(lp63034
S"I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're   not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake."
p63035
aS'Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.'
p63036
aS'Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...   And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According   to the back cover of that book that you gave me.'
p63037
aS"Rach, she's not going to remember this."
p63038
aS'I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this   day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her   cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET   OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!'
p63039
aS'Hey!'
p63040
aS'What?'
p63041
aS"It's not bad."
p63042
aS'Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a   bunny. How did you do that?'
p63043
aS'Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this   to make ears.'
p63044
aa(lp63045
S"Well, I'm very impressed."
p63046
aS'Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into   woodland creatures.'
p63047
aS'Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.'
p63048
aS"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?"
p63049
aS'Game?'
p63050
aS"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,   that's little."
p63051
aS"Ooh! That's my girl!"
p63052
aS"That's how old you are."
p63053
aS'Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?'
p63054
aS'Ooh, I want one...'
p63055
aa(lp63056
S'Me too...'
p63057
aS"There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?"
p63058
aS'...and head to Canada!'
p63059
aS'I was kidding.'
p63060
aS"I wasn't. Let's get going!"
p63061
aS'Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?'
p63062
aS'No, not yet.'
p63063
aS"Oh good, I didn't miss the party."
p63064
aS'What about your massage client?'
p63065
aS"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,   you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright."
p63066
aa(lp63067
S"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE   TIME!"
p63068
aS"I've been here the whole time!"
p63069
aS'Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.'
p63070
aS"I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks   you guys!"
p63071
aS'Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.'
p63072
aS'What?'
p63073
aS'Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?'
p63074
aS'Wo-ish.'
p63075
aS"Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!"
p63076
aS"Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means..."
p63077
aa(lp63078
S'NO, no science camp!'
p63079
aS"Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake."
p63080
aS'Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!'
p63081
aS'Thanks!'
p63082
aS"Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow   out the candle. Come on Emma."
p63083
aS"Let's do it, come on!"
p63084
aS"What's wrong? Are you okay?"
p63085
aS'Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.'
p63086
aS'Hey, you made it into a bunny.'
p63087
aS'What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it   was a penis.'
p63088
aa(lp63089
S'Okay.'
p63090
aS'Okay, you ready?'
p63091
aS'Yeah.'
p63092
aS'A-a-and... record.'
p63093
aS'Okay.  Hi Emma. Well,   your first birthday is over, and it was really...'
p63094
aS'Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!'
p63095
aS"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her   first cookie."
p63096
aS'Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!'
p63097
aS"I've never given her a cookie. Have you?"
p63098
aS"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from   a can!"
p63099
aa(lp63100
S'Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we   were wondering if you would write one for us.'
p63101
aS"Of course, I'd be honored!"
p63102
aS'Thanks!'
p63103
aS'Thank you!'
p63104
aS"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
p63105
aS"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
p63106
aS'Yeah, it\'s just we don\'t think of you as really being so much "with   the words".'
p63107
aS'Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!'
p63108
aS'Clearly we were wrong.'
p63109
aS'I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how   much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.'
p63110
aa(lp63111
S'You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.'
p63112
aS'Thank you! Alright, let me see how I\'m gonna start... "Dear baby   adoption decider people..."'
p63113

p63120
aS'YEAH!'
p63121
aa(lp63122
S'So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?'
p63123
aS'Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.'
p63124
aS"Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?"
p63125
aS"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so   no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put   on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room."
p63126
aS"You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex inour bathroom!"
p63127
aS"That's where people make number two!!"
p63128
aS'Hey!'
p63129
aS'Hey...'

p63248
aS'Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, but I think   it\xe2\x80\x99s really good that she\xe2\x80\x99s here.'
p63249
aS"'Cause we will appreciate it more when she\xe2\x80\x99s gone?"

p63257
aS'Oh, sweety, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pull this off.'
p63258
aS"Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time   for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
p63259
aS'Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, honey. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.  I am not happy.    Oh... sure you wanna eat that?'

aS'Word!'
p63267
aS'Well, mine was worse than that.'
p63268
aS'Well, what happened?'
p63269
aS'We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the   big screen thing...'
p63270
aS'Oh, that is so tacky.'
p63271
aS'Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning   on proposing to me that same way last night!'
p63272
aS'Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?'
p63273

S'Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna   propose to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s ever gonna ask again! I mean,   I said no in Barbados and now this!'
p63277
aS"She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a  guy..?"
p63278
aS"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to   him!"
p63279
aS"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
p63280
aS'I proposed to Chandler!  Alright,   moving on...'
p63281
aS"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
p63282

aS'How about at a game, on the big screen?'
p63289
aS'Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?'
p63290
aS"What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,   plus he'd never suspect it!"
p63291
aS'Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?'
p63292
aS'Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?'
p63293
aS'Nana is on the phone'
p63294
aS"Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years   ago!!"

p63297
aa(lp63298

p63299
aS'Menstrual cramps.'

aS'Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!'
p63313
aS"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!"
p63314
aS"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
p63315
aS'Wha... the next one?'
p63316
aS"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby."

aS'Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge   breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!'
p63318
aS"I... I don't know.."
p63319
aa(lp63320
S"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand   how important that is in our world?"

p63325

p63326
aS'You dropped it off?'
p63327
aS'Yeah.'
p63328
aS'Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?'
p63329
aS"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to   hand-write it."
p63330
aa(lp63331
S'You hand-wrote it?'
p63332
aS"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at  all! See ya later!"
p63333
aS"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our   file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples   that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
p63334
aS"It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just   call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter."
p63335
aS'Okay good.'
p63336
aS'Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped   off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...   okay... thank you. Good-bye. .'
p63337
aS"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way   to the bird store."
p63338
aS'They loved it.'
p63339
aS'What?'
p63340
aS'They thought it was very smart of us to have a  child write the recommendation letter.'
p63341
aa(lp63342
S'They thought Joey was a child?'
p63343
aS'She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.'

p63357
aS"Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would   it?"
p63358
aS'I think she looks cute.    ... but I am wrong!'
p63359

p63366
aS"Nah, I don't really want her to see."
p63367
aS'Why not?'
p63368
aS'Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.'

aS'Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!'
p63382
aS"I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure   out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?"
p63383
aS"Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going   to do with my life."
p63384
aS'Oh yeah? Since when?'
p63385
aa(lp63386
S'Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.'
p63387
aS'What?'
p63388
aS"That's not a thing!"
p63389
aS"Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what   colors to wear, what clothes are slimming..."

p63404
aS'Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the   big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.'
p63405

p63406

aS'Joey, where are those bags?'
p63422
aS'She has a lot of crap!'
p63423

aS'Well, ok, it\'s for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get   it, I\'ll finally be able to complete my field research! And there   will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!   That\'ll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious   questions   about my work!'
p63513
aS'Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?'
p63514
aS'Yeah. Why?'
p63515
aS'Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.'
p63516
aS'Your ex-boyfriend?'
p63517
aa(lp63518
S'Yeah.'
p63519
aS'So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new   boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!'
p63520
aS"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,   I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner   together, and I can introduce you."
p63521
aS'Well, if you think it would help.'
p63522
aS"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him."
p63523
aS'Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,   butter him up? Anything he really likes?'
p63524
aS'Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.'
p63525
aS"We'll see how dinner goes."
p63526
aS'Hey!'
p63527
aS'Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?'
p63528
aa(lp63529
S'Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing   out stuff, so Mike could move in.'
p63530
aS'Oh, right.'
p63531
aS'Yeah.'
p63532
aS"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you   with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!"
p63533
aS"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did  you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?"
p63534
aS'Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?'
p63535
aS'A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me   to get rid of Gladys.'
p63536
aS"Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!"
p63537
aS'Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,  I know!! Oh, you should take her!'
p63538
aS"Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know..."
p63539
aa(lp63540
S"Why, you don't like her?"
p63541
aS"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll   take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too   easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!"
p63542
aS'Really? You think?'
p63543
aS'Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I\'m sorry   Mike I can\'t live without her, she means too much to me!"'
p63544
aS"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just   realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her."
p63545
aS'Damn it, I did not think this through!'
p63546
aS'Hey you guys.'
p63547
aS'Hi!'
p63548
aS'Oh! Any word on casting yet?'
p63549
aS"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for   the part."
p63550
aa(lp63551
S"What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor   you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
p63552
aS"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna   be interested in."
p63553
aS"Look, c'mon, please? It's   not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I   am a professional actor!  Oh, man,   I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a   copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in."
p63554
aS'Joe...'
p63555
aS"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't   pass it on to your bosses!"
p63556
aS'Fine!'
p63557
aS'Thank you.'
p63558
aS'Work, Joe!'
p63559
aS'Damn it!'
p63560
aS'What am I gonna do now?'
p63561
aa(lp63562
S'Just pass it to your boss!'
p63563
aS"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should   learn on their own!"
p63564
aS"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked   it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and   they're the bad guys."
p63565
aS"That's good! I liked it, they didn't.    Joey, for God's sake,   go to work! ."
p63566
aS"I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.   I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner   party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley   or C3PO?"
p63567
aS"Sorry, looks   like it's just him."
p63568
aS'Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!'
p63569
aS'Well, I... I am having a good hair day.'
p63570
aS'So good to see you.'
p63571
aS'Me too.'
p63572
aa(lp63573
S"I'm ok."
p63574
aS"I'm sorry...  Ross   Geller... Benjamin Hobart."
p63575
aS"It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell   you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,    whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of   the reasons I got into the field."
p63576
aS"Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've   never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!"
p63577
aS'Shall we? .'
p63578
aS"Thank you! . I can't   believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?"
p63579
aS"Oh my God, I completely forgot!  Oh  my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! ."
p63580
aS"You weren't there!"
p63581
aS"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,   you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz,   mmm."
p63582
aS"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,   while I go to the ladies room?"
p63583
aa(lp63584
S'So, tell me about it.'
p63585
aS'Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.'
p63586
aS'M-m.'
p63587
aS"See, there are still several areas that haven't   been fully excavated."
p63588
aS'Break up with Charlie!'
p63589
aS'What?'
p63590
aS'What?'
p63591
aS'Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?'
p63592
aS"Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I   didn't not say it."
p63593
aS"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
p63594
aa(lp63595
S"I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so   long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much   I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her."
p63596
aS'Are you serious?'
p63597
aS"If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then   I'm joking!"
p63598
aS'No!'
p63599
aS'Joking it is!'
p63600
aS"Hi! Sorry, I'm late."
p63601
aS'Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you   keep the painting?'
p63602
aS"No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me   keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news   is, Gladys is yours!"
p63603
aS"Wow, what's the bad news!"
p63604
aS"Who's Gladys?"
p63605
aa(lp63606
S"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,   with the woman coming out of the frame."
p63607
aS'Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?  In her house? I am so jealous!'
p63608
aS"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!"
p63609
aS'Huh!'
p63610
aS'Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already   gave that to Monica, so...'
p63611
aS'You know, I would give her up, for you.'
p63612
aS"No, I couldn't let you do that."
p63613
aS'But I want to.'
p63614
aS"But I don't want you to."
p63615
aS'But I insist!'
p63616
aa(lp63617
S'But I insist harder!'
p63618
aS"Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,   she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!"
p63619
aS'No, that landed in your food!'
p63620
aS"No, no, that's ok. You won fair   and square. I'm so sad!"
p63621
aS'Hey Joe!'
p63622
aS"What's up?"
p63623
aS"Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested."
p63624
aS'Oh.'
p63625
aS"I'm sorry man."
p63626
aS'But, ehm... you watched   the tape?'
p63627
aa(lp63628
S"Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.   Stupid sons of bitches!"
p63629
aS"You didn't watch the tape."
p63630
aS'What!? Of course I did!'
p63631
aS"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
p63632
aS"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
p63633
aS'Well, you lied again!'
p63634
aS'I watched it!'
p63635
aS'Keep going Pinocchio!'
p63636
aS'I did!'
p63637
aS"No you didn't!"
p63638
aa(lp63639
S"I'm telling you, I watched the tape."
p63640
aS'Did you watch the tape?'
p63641
aS'No!'
p63642
aS"The selection committee has chosen the three of   you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers   you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you   claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you   propose to correct this problem?"
p63643
aS'Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological   evidence. I plan to begin there.'
p63644
aS'Interesting.'
p63645
aS'I guess!'
p63646
aS'Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.   Where might that take place?'
p63647
aS'Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.'
p63648
aS'Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my   birthday?'
p63649
aa(lp63650
S'What? I... I...'
p63651
aS'Care to venture a guess?'
p63652
aS'May 12th?'
p63653
aS"That's not even   kinda close!  Dr. Li, how many graduate students   you'd be needing?"
p63654
aS'Half a dozen.'
p63655
aS'I see, and Dr. Biely?'
p63656
aS'Three for excavation and two for analysis.'
p63657
aS'Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit   was later covered by a popular British invasion band?'
p63658
aS'Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.'
p63659
aS'No! I\'m sorry, we were looking for "Baby It\'s   You". Baby It\'s You.'
p63660
aa(lp63661
S'Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my   questions have anything to do with Paleontology.'
p63662
aS'You\'re right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.   Spell "Boscodictiasaur".'
p63663
aS'um... I\'ve never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".'
p63664
aS'Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.'
p63665
aS'Ok.  B - O - S ...'
p63666
aS'No, it starts with a silent "M".'
p63667
aS'Oh come on!!'
p63668
aS"I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!"
p63669
aS'But you are a liar.'
p63670
aS'What did I just say?'
p63671
aa(lp63672
S'You still here?'
p63673
aS'Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am   insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...'
p63674
aS'Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?   First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about   lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying   about... lying...   Stop lying!'
p63675
aS"Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?"
p63676
aS'You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?'
p63677
aS'Well, this is going well.'
p63678
aS"Here's how I know you didn't   watch the tape, ok?  If you had seen what was on this   tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I   got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan."
p63679
aS"And that's how I know you   didn't watch the tape! ."
p63680
aS'He really is a chameleon.'
p63681
aS'Well, Gladys say hello to   your new home!'
p63682
aa(lp63683
S'Oh, my!'
p63684
aS"Wow!  Oh,   she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh   so proudly?"
p63685
aS"I haven't really settled on a spot yet!"
p63686
aS'Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be   the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!'
p63687
aS'Yeah, yeah! And you can   get rid of that French poster.'
p63688
aS'I like that poster!'
p63689
aS"Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.   Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?"
p63690
aS"Oh! There's   nothing above your bed!!"
p63691
aS'Are you still here?'
p63692
aS"Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology   related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?    Aunt Margaret's pants size?"
p63693
aa(lp63694
S"I've come here to apologize. I think I may have   let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process."
p63695
aS'No! Stop!'
p63696
aS"Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant."
p63697
aS'Really?'
p63698
aS'Well... there is just one small... stipulation...'
p63699
aS'I have to break up with Charlie?'
p63700
aS'Hey, you got one right!'
p63701
aS"You're crazy."
p63702
aS'Crazy, or... romantic?'
p63703
aS'Crazy!'
p63704
aa(lp63705
S'Ooor...'
p63706
aS'Get out!'
p63707
aS'O-oh my God!'
p63708
aS'What?'
p63709
aS'Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?'
p63710
aS'I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very   reasonable price.'
p63711
aS"Joey, we're not keeping this!"
p63712
aS"But it's an original Buffay..."
p63713
aS"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't   mind that she's haunted."
p63714
aS'Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?'
p63715
aa(lp63716
S"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive   when you're asleep."
p63717
aS'She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body   across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.    And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your   doorknob.'
p63718
aS'GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!'
p63719
aS'Hey! I sold that to Joey.'
p63720
aS"Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at   this game."
p63721
aS"No, too late. You can't give it back!"
p63722
aS'Yes I can!'
p63723
aS"No you can't. She's yours!"
p63724
aS"She's yours!"
p63725
aS"SHE'S YOURS!"
p63726
aa(lp63727
S"She's yours!"
p63728
aS'Hey!'
p63729
aS"She's mine!"
p63730
aS"She's m-i-i-ne!"
p63731
aS"She's mine!"
p63732
aS"She's mine!"
p63733
aS"You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her   anymore.  Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis."
p63734
aS'I want Gladys!'
p63735
aS"She's mine!"
p63736
aS"She's mine!"
p63737
aa(lp63738
S"She's mine!"
p63739
aS"She's mine!"
p63740
aS"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And   I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part   or not."
p63741
aS"That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you   lied."
p63742
aS"I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you   to forgive me?"
p63743
aS'Oh my God!'
p63744
aS'Excellent!'
p63745
aS'Now, what do you say?'
p63746
aS'Lying is wrong!'
p63747
aS'And?... AND?'
p63748
aa(lp63749
S"I'm a pretty little girl."
p63750
aS'I knew it!'
p63751
aS'Your ex-boyfriend is insane.'
p63752
aS'Did you get the grant?'
p63753
aS"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your   ex-boyfriend is still in love with you."
p63754
aS'What?'
p63755
aS"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't   give you up."
p63756
aS"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up   with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man."
p63757
aS'Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,   who was the voice of "Underdog"?'
p63758
aS"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross."
p63759
aa(lp63760
S"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?   I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
p63761
aS'Seriously?'
p63762
aS"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do   you spell Mboscodictiosaur?"
p63763
aS"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then   M-B-O..."
p63764
aS'Damnit!'
p63765
aS'Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are   you doing here?'
p63766
aS"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you   tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the   voice of Underdog!"
p63767
aS'Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,   this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.'
p63768
aS"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in   the eyes, and tell her the truth."
p63769
aS'Benji?'
p63770
aa(lp63771
S"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's   only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in   my life."
p63772
aS'Too little, too late, Benji!'
p63773
aS"I can't believe this."
p63774
aS'I never should have broken up with you. I think   about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?'
p63775
aS'No!'
p63776
aS'Yes!'
p63777
aS'What?'
p63778
aS"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....   romantic."
p63779
aS'or...'
p63780
aS'Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,   but is there any chance you will take me back?'
p63781
aa(lp63782
S'Maybe...'
p63783
aS'Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a   little uncomfortable.'
p63784
aS"Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
p63785
aS"I'm sorry   too..."
p63786
aS'I love you!'
p63787
aS'I love you too!'
p63788
aS"Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!"
p63789
aS'Gladys?'
p63790
aS'Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not   get old.'
p63791
aS"You're mean!"
p63792
aa(lp63793
S"Oh, don't be such a baby!"
p63794
aS'Hey you guys!'
p63795
aS'Hey!'
p63796
aS'Hey, what are you doing?'
p63797
aS'Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.'
p63798
aS"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
p63799
aS'Yeah!'
p63800
aS"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea   how expensive this stuff was!"
p63801
aS'Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the   numbers.'
p63802
aS'So what did you two do about it?'
p63803
aa(lp63804
S'It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting   solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.'
p63805
aS"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact   that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
p63806
aS'I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.'
p63807
aS"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that."
p63808
aS'But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?'
p63809
aS'Are you serious?'
p63810
aS'Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity   and we just got married at City Hall?'
p63811
aS'I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.'
p63812
aS"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!"
p63813
aS'Maybe you do that next time you get married!'
p63814
aa(lp63815
S"No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.  But   maybe the time after that!"
p63816
aS'Hey!'
p63817
aS'Hey!'
p63818
aS"What's going on?"
p63819
aS'Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning   the apartment.'
p63820
aS'We?'
p63821
aS"You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!"
p63822
aS'Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?'
p63823
aS"Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live."
p63824
aS"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about   us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
p63825
aa(lp63826
S"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very   impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
p63827
aS'Little people?'
p63828
aS'Celebrity.'
p63829
aS"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff   hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
p63830
aS'What...? NO!'
p63831
aS'Chandler?'
p63832
aS"I don't, and I'm offended   by the insinuation!"
p63833
aS"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes   taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?"
p63834
aS"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not   mine."
p63835
aS"It isn't mine!"
p63836
aa(lp63837
S"Well, I guess we'll never know whose   it is!"
p63838
aS'May I help you?'
p63839
aS"Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children."
p63840
aS'Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.'
p63841
aS"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one"
p63842
aS'Well, this is very generous!'
p63843
aS"And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous."
p63844
aS'Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.'
p63845
aS'Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.'
p63846
aS'Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.'
p63847
aa(lp63848
S'Not necessary.'
p63849
aS'Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.'
p63850
aS'And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".'
p63851
aS'Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.'
p63852
aS'Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!'
p63853
aS'It does. It feels really good!'
p63854
aS'Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!'
p63855
aS"Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym."
p63856
aS"Mhm... it's moist."
p63857
aS'Hi!'
p63858
aa(lp63859
S'Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!'
p63860
aS'Oh, good!'
p63861
aS"Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry."
p63862
aS"Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists   out there."
p63863
aS'Absolutely.'
p63864
aS"There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under   a bridge!"
p63865
aS'So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?'
p63866
aS'Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!'
p63867
aS'Oh my God, what!?'
p63868
aS'Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and   fire!'
p63869
aa(lp63870
S'Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.'
p63871
aS'Be-caaauuuse...'
p63872
aS'All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing   incident... when I was little.'
p63873
aS'Seriously?'
p63874
aS'Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden   my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut   a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!'
p63875
aS"And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you   in the movie!"
p63876
aS'Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And   I was thinking Claire Danes.'
p63877
aS"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly   safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and   you'll see!"
p63878
aS"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and   there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're   gonna return back to earth!"
p63879
aS'Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come   on, you know, when you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the look on Emma\xe2\x80\x99s face, I swear you   won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it.'
p63880
aa(lp63881
S'All right!'
p63882
aS'Good, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their   irrational fears on their children, do you?'
p63883
aS'Irrational, huh? All right, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that the next   time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!'
p63884
aS'Oh, yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the same, I am sure there are thirty different   species of poisonous swings!'
p63885
aS'Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!'
p63886
aS'Ok, ok, here we go.'
p63887
aS'Ok.'
p63888
aS'Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile.'
p63889
aS'Hello, is this the creepy residence?'
p63890
aS'We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad   you\xe2\x80\x99re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you wanna use it, but\xe2\x80\xa6'
p63891
aa(lp63892
S'Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won\xe2\x80\x99t be needing   a veil, I actually won\xe2\x80\x99t be wearing a dress at all!'
p63893
aS'I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!'
p63894
aS'No, no, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not having a big reception, we took the money   we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.'
p63895
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t   imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!'
p63896
aS'We, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re different! We don\xe2\x80\x99t care about having   a huge party.  This is really nice for you, but, oh,   please, I put this on?  And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant.  All right, well, who cares,   I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.'
p63897
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s right. You\xe2\x80\x99re making a commitment and that\xe2\x80\x99s   the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?'
p63898
aS'City Hall.'
p63899
aS'Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just   there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!'
p63900
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s ok, it\xe2\x80\x99s ok. I made my decision. What I really want   is a great big wedding'
p63901
aS'Yay!'
p63902
aa(lp63903
S'But you already gave all your money to charity!'
p63904
aS'Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask for it back!'
p63905
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do that!'
p63906
aS'Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some   stupid kids!'
p63907
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.'
p63908
aS'Ok, careful.'
p63909
aS'Ok.'
p63910
aS'Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!'
p63911
aS'Rach, she\xe2\x80\x99s got like three hairs!'
p63912
aS'I know  but they\xe2\x80\x99re just so beautiful!   Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.'
p63913
aa(lp63914
S'I promise you she\xe2\x80\x99s safe! No watch how much she loves this.'
p63915
aS'Ok.'
p63916
aS'Ready sweety?'
p63917
aS'Ok.'
p63918
aS'Here we go!'
p63919
aS'Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s smiling! Oh my God,   she does like it!'
p63920
aS'See, I told you!'
p63921
aS'Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she\xe2\x80\x99s a little dare-devil!   Oh, let me push, can I push?'
p63922
aS'Oh, absolutely!'
p63923
aS'Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the diaper bag.'
p63924
aa(lp63925
S'Ok!  See? Scared   of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!'
p63926
aS'We\xe2\x80\x99re seriously asking for our money back?'
p63927
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,   because one of us gonna have to start flirting.'
p63928
aS'Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don\xe2\x80\x99t   think that that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened before.'
p63929
aS'Gay, go.'
p63930
aS'Oh my God, I love your shirt!'
p63931
aS'The donation we made earlier, we k\xe2\x80\xa6, we w\xe2\x80\xa6, we want it   back.'
p63932
aS'Excuse me?'
p63933
aS'Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn\xe2\x80\x99t   want, but it turns out we do.'
p63934
aS'So you\xe2\x80\x99re asking us to refund your donation to the children?'
p63935
aa(lp63936
S'Yeah! This feels really good.'
p63937
aS'I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.'
p63938
aS'Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my business,  besides it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good thing. We really would have been   spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing\xe2\x80\xa6'
p63939
aS'Hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair! A person\xe2\x80\x99s wedding is important!   And especially to me! Ok? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a graduation party! And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t   go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an   escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to \xe2\x80\x9ckill me\xe2\x80\x9d   or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty   little man make me feel badly about it.'
p63940
aS'She could have been talking about either one of us.'
p63941
aS'Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.'
p63942
aS'Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.'
p63943
aS'Thank you!'
p63944
aS'Would you like something to drink?'
p63945
aS'Oh, water would be fine.'
p63946
aa(lp63947
S'Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We\xe2\x80\x99re really excited   about getting this process started.'
p63948
aS"Oh, because we love kids. Love \xe2\x80\x98em to death.Well, not actually   to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...   as allowed by law."
p63949
aS'Your place is just lovely.'
p63950
aS'Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.'
p63951
aS"You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples   in the"
p63952
aS'Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby   before'
p63953
aS'But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.'
p63954
aS'Oh...'
p63955
aS'What?'
p63956
aS'I just realized why I remember this place.'
p63957
aa(lp63958
S'Really? What is it?'
p63959
aS"Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building   and it"
p63960
aS"Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?"
p63961
aS'Yes!'
p63962
aS'Of course it was!'
p63963
aS'Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he   would call'

p63966
aS'OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,   no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!'

aa(lp63969

p63970

aS'Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.   That is'
p63975
aS"No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault   and kind"
p63976
aS"Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else   gets"
p63977
aS'No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,   okay? And'
p63978

p63981

p63982
aS'Good.'
p63983
aS'If you hold a spider.'
p63984
aS'WHAT?   WHERE? WHERE?'
p63985
aS'IF you hold a spider.'
p63986
aS'I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,'
p63987
aS"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe..."
p63988
aS'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!'
p63989

aS'Guys!?'
p63993

p63995
aS"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!"
p63996
aS"Everything doesn't sound fine!"
p63997
aS'Is he alright out there by himself?'
p63998
aS'Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.'
p63999
aS'Bert and Ernie!'

p64003
aS'Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.'
p64004
aS"Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really   deserve that."
p64005
aS'Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for   a few'
p64006
aS"No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there."
p64007
aS"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted."
p64008
aS"Alright, fine. We'll give the money back."
p64009
aS"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't   shot"
p64010
aS'Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child   in.'
p64011
aS'Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the   furniture,'
p64012
aa(lp64013
S'Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything   I need'
p64014
aS"Why don't I show you the baby's room?"
p64015
aS'What the hell are you doing?'
p64016
aS"Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble."
p64017
aS"Well, we're not."
p64018
aS"But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!"
p64019
aS"We don't have a code word."
p64020
aS"We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word   for danger."
p64021
aS"So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey   behind"
p64022

p64023
aa(lp64024

aS'Are you friends with him?'
p64038
aS'I can explain... Joey...'
p64039
aS"Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back   here. I can't believe you never called me."
p64040
aS'Excuse me?'
p64041
aS"Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by   the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...   lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me."
p64042
aS'I gave you my number, you never called me.'
p64043
aS"No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...   social work, ok, that you can just... do."

p64047
aS"I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry..."
p64048
aS'No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You   know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?'
p64049
aS'Joey, wait!'
p64050
aS"NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore..."
p64051
aS"I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed..."
p64052
aS"Oh, that's really ok."
p64053

p64059

p64060
aS"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children."
p64061
aS"Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!"
p64062
aS"If I haven't said so already sir,    congratulations!"
p64063
aS"Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping   in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this   decision for us.  Now... what do you think we should do?"
p64064
aS"You know what? It's not your decision anymore."
p64065
aS'What?'

p64071
aS'Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful   life together.'
p64072
aS'Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come   back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.'
p64073

p64083

aS"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
p64107
aS"That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!"
p64108
aS'No, no! We made this decision together.'
p64109
aS"She's putting words in your mouth!"
p64110
aS"Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!"
p64111
aa(lp64112
S"I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!"
p64113
aS"No, it's not!"
p64114
aS"It's not?  When was she born?"
p64115
aS"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
p64116
aS'Thank you, Pheebs!'
p64117
aS"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."
p64118
aS'What? You are way off, lady!'
p64119
aS"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself."
p64120
aS"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!"
p64121
aS"Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!"
p64122
aa(lp64123
S'Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!'
p64124
aS'We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?'
p64125
aS'Hey!'
p64126
aS'Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!'
p64127
aS'Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.'
p64128
aS'You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?'
p64129
aS"You're not making the pies yourself?"
p64130
aS"No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick."
p64131
aS'Did you at least win the contest?'
p64132
aS'2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.'
p64133
aa(lp64134
S"Can't wait!"
p64135
aS'This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!'
p64136
aS'Hey Rach.'
p64137
aS'Yeah.'
p64138
aS"What's Emma doing today?"
p64139
aS"Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?"
p64140
aS'Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.'
p64141
aS"Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!"
p64142
aS"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
p64143
aS'Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!'
p64144
aa(lp64145
S'Oh... okay.'
p64146
aS"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy..."
p64147
aS'And a thousand dollars.'
p64148
aS"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important..."
p64149
aS'Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.'
p64150
aS'Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?'
p64151
aS'Well, I was thinking...'
p64152
aS"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid."
p64153
aS'Yeah!'
p64154
aS'Did someone drop the baton again?'
p64155
aa(lp64156
S'Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?'
p64157
aS"I don't get older. I just get better!"
p64158
aS'You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!'
p64159
aS"You don't know that."
p64160
aS'Somebody is gonna pick us.'
p64161
aS"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
p64162
aS"I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!"
p64163
aS'Name one of his books.'
p64164
aS'"The Firm"?'
p64165
aS"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
p64166
aa(lp64167
S'You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.'
p64168
aS"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do."
p64169
aS'I\'m serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".'
p64170
aS"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it."
p64171
aS'Tell me more.'
p64172
aS"Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!!"
p64173
aS"You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!"
p64174
aS'Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!'
p64175
aS"Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!"
p64176
aS'Dude, I wanted him to guess.'
p64177
aa(lp64178
S'Oh.'
p64179
aS'Oh my God!'
p64180
aS"Yeah, they're great seats too!"
p64181
aS'Guess where they are?'
p64182
aS'Center ice.'
p64183
aS'Did I do something to you?'
p64184
aS"Hmm, the game's at one."
p64185
aS'So?'
p64186
aS"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
p64187
aS"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
p64188
aa(lp64189
S'You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.'
p64190
aS'Dude, two times that happened!'
p64191
aS"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
p64192
aS"He's right, man."
p64193
aS'Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.'
p64194
aS'Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!'
p64195
aS"That's some gentle comedy, dude."
p64196
aS"We're still going at the game, right?"
p64197
aS'Yeah!'
p64198
aS'Yeah.'
p64199
aa(lp64200
S'This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...'
p64201
aS'Hey.'
p64202
aS"Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
p64203
aS"We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
p64204
aS"Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
p64205
aS"Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.  It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man."
p64206
aS"Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!"
p64207
aS"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!"
p64208
aS'Phoebe, you have to calm down.'
p64209
aS'Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!'
p64210
aa(lp64211
S'Really?'
p64212
aS'Yeah!'
p64213
aS'You heard them say that?'
p64214
aS'Yeah!'
p64215
aS"All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!"
p64216
aS"Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!"
p64217
aS'No, what?'
p64218
aS"Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!"
p64219
aS'No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!'
p64220
aS'Why not!'
p64221
aa(lp64222
S'Because I already did!'
p64223
aS'Oh, Bob, get off the guy!'
p64224
aS'Oh! What a game, huh?'
p64225
aS'I know, yeah.'
p64226
aS"I can't believe Chandler is missing this!"
p64227
aS"Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
p64228
aS"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away."
p64229
aS'Ohhhh! These seats are great!'
p64230
aS"I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!"
p64231
aS"Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
p64232
aa(lp64233
S"Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal."
p64234
aS"I don't know..."
p64235
aS'One more fight!'
p64236
aS'Okay.'
p64237
aS'Okay.'
p64238
aS"Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!"
p64239
aS"I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!"
p64240
aS'How late are we?'
p64241
aS'Forty-five minutes.'
p64242
aS'Wow'
p64243
aa(lp64244
S'Here!'
p64245
aS'Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!'
p64246
aS'You may want to lose the foam finger!'
p64247
aS'Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!'
p64248
aS'Hey!'
p64249
aS'Oh!'
p64250
aS'You are not at Thanksgiving?'
p64251
aS'No...'
p64252
aS"No, we're late!"
p64253
aS'What are you doing here!'
p64254
aa(lp64255
S"We're late too!"
p64256
aS'We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time'
p64257
aS"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!"
p64258
aS"So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!"
p64259
aS'Yeah, where were you!'
p64260
aS"Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!"
p64261
aS'Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!'
p64262
aS'And I won!'
p64263
aS'You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.'
p64264
aS'Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes!'
p64265
aa(lp64266
S'Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.'
p64267
aS"Yeah. That's me!"
p64268
aS'You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?'
p64269
aS'And it looks like she put makeup on her!'
p64270
aS'Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...'
p64271
aS"I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!"
p64272
aS'She won a thousand dollars!'
p64273
aS'So this is an annual thing?'
p64274
aS"Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!"
p64275
aS'You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!'
p64276
aa(lp64277
S'Yeah. What are we gonna do?'
p64278
aS"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap."
p64279
aS"All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae."
p64280
aS'Alright, what are we gonna say?'
p64281
aS"Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!"
p64282
aS"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
p64283
aS'No. Here'
p64284
aS'HEY!'
p64285
aS'Do you hear something?'
p64286
aS"They're out there!"
p64287
aa(lp64288
S"Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
p64289
aS'Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!'
p64290
aS'Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!'
p64291
aS"Ross' shirt is torn."
p64292
aS"Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!"
p64293
aS'Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?'
p64294
aS'I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.'
p64295
aS"We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her."
p64296
aS'That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.'
p64297
aS"You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time."
p64298
aa(lp64299
S"We know you're out there."
p64300
aS'Who do you think its from?'
p64301
aS'Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.'
p64302
aS"Well, let's just go in there and face them."
p64303
aS"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy."
p64304
aS"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
p64305
aS"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.  Ready? ."
p64306
aS'Ah-haah! I win!!'
p64307
aS'What is that?'
p64308
aS"That's fire. Beats everything."
p64309
aa(lp64310
S'Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .'
p64311
aS'Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.'
p64312
aS"Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time."
p64313
aS'Alright, okay.'
p64314
aS"It's locked."
p64315
aS'Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they\'re having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".'
p64316
aS"Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together."
p64317
aS"No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy."
p64318
aS"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?"
p64319
aS"Nothing. It's fine."
p64320
aa(lp64321
S'Oh thank God!'
p64322
aS"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down."
p64323
aS"That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand."
p64324
aS'FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!'
p64325
aS"You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey."
p64326
aS'I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.'
p64327
aS"That's all the turkey you're gonna get."
p64328
aS'How are we gonna decide who gets this?'
p64329
aS'WATER BALLOON!'
p64330
aS"What are we gonna do? I'm starving."
p64331
aa(lp64332
S'Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.'
p64333
aS'Oh yeah!'
p64334
aS'Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.'
p64335
aS"Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it."
p64336
aS"Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS."
p64337
aS"That's worse than no food."
p64338
aS"HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!"
p64339
aS'Stinky?!'
p64340
aS'Please let me stay on this side of the door.'
p64341
aS'Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.'
p64342
aa(lp64343
S"Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us."
p64344
aS"You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together."
p64345
aS'Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.'
p64346
aS"I don't know..."
p64347
aS"I'm telling ya...  I can do it."
p64348
aS'Yeah, he can do it!'
p64349
aS'Oh!'
p64350
aS'Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...'
p64351
aS'The cranberries...?'
p64352
aS"Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!"
p64353
aa(lp64354
S'Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.'
p64355
aS"He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!"
p64356
aS"Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys?"
p64357
aS'I feel terrible.'
p64358
aS'So, so sorry.'
p64359
aS"Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
p64360
aS'The floating heads do make a good point.'
p64361
aS'Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.'
p64362
aS'So bad.'
p64363
aS'So bad.'
p64364
aa(lp64365
S'So bad.'
p64366

p64367
aS'Dessert?'

aS'Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?'
p64369
aS'Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .'
p64370
aS'Grand Supreme Little Darling?'
p64371
aS'Congratulatioooons!'
p64372
aS"Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do."
p64373
aS'Really girls, not cool.'
p64374
aS"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
p64375
aa(lp64376
S"Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!"
p64377
aS"It's a day to be thankful."
p64378
aS"Don't make me come up there!"
p64379
aS"It's too late for apologies."
p64380
aS"Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner."
p64381
aS"That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling."
p64382
aS'Ewww, is that what that is?'
p64383
aS'Sorry!'
p64384
aS"Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving."
p64385
aS"Yeah! I'll cook!"
p64386
aa(lp64387

p64388
aS'Hey!'
p64389
aS'Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.'
p64390

p64392
aS'Ha!'
p64393
aS"Oh-oh! I'm stuck!"
p64394
aS'Joey, that is not gonna work.'
p64395

p64397
aa(lp64398
S'Okay.'
p64399
aS"aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head."
p64400
aS'A little late for that.'
p64401
aS'Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.'
p64402
aS'Alright, well, this does not change anything.  Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.'
p64403
aS"Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
p64404
aS'Bring it.'
p64405
aS"I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person..."
p64406
aS'Here you go!'
p64407
aS'Oh, that smells good!'
p64408
aa(lp64409
S'Okay.'
p64410
aS'Okay, try it.'
p64411
aS"It isn't working."
p64412
aS"Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain."
p64413
aS"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!"
p64414
aS'Can you ever feel your ears?'
p64415
aS'Interesting...'
p64416
aS'Chandler, where are your tools?'
p64417
aS"Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!"
p64418
aS'I do, but Rachel borrowed them.'
p64419
aa(lp64420
S'I lent them to Ross.'
p64421
aS'I gave them to Joey.'
p64422
aS'I left them at the park.'
p64423
aS'Oh!'
p64424
aS"I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him."
p64425
aS"I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants."
p64426
aS'Nice!'
p64427
aS'Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.'
p64428
aS"It's really starting to hurt."
p64429
aS"Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!"
p64430

aS'Yeah! Come on!'
p64435

p64436
aS'My cranberries!'
p64437
aS"Man, I've got food all over me."
p64438
aS"Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!"
p64439
aS'Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!'
p64440
aS"I don't care."
p64441
aa(lp64442
S"What's going on?"
p64443
aS'That was the adoption agency...'
p64444
aS'And?'
p64445
aS"WE'RE GETTING A BABY!"
p64446
aS'Are you serious?'
p64447
aS"There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!"
p64448
aS"I'm so happy for you!"
p64449
aS"This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!"
p64450
aS'To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.'
p64451
aS"I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid."
p64452
aa(lp64453
S'I know. Have you considered pageanting?'
p64454
aS"I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby."
p64455
aS'Oh, I know how you feel...'
p64456
aS'Really?'
p64457
aS'Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!'
p64458
aS'That is the exact same thing.'
p64459
aS'Hi!'

aa(lp64464
S'Oh, right! Your adoption interview!'
p64465
aS"Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
p64466
aS"I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!"
p64467
aS'And so incorrect!'
p64468
aS"She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us."
p64469
aS"Come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
p64470
aS"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
p64471
aS'And a lot could still get in our way.'
p64472
aS'Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..'
p64473
aS'What are you gonna name the baby?'
p64474
aa(lp64475
S'I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.'
p64476
aS'But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?'
p64477
aS"Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!"
p64478
aS"So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?"
p64479
aS"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!"
p64480
aS'Yes, but...'
p64481
aS"Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)"
p64482
aS"Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
p64483

aa(lp64486
S'Hey!'
p64487
aS"So... who's your friend?"
p64488
aS"Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
p64489
aS'OW, why, why, why?'
p64490
aS"Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
p64491
aS'Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.'
p64492
aS'Mandy.'
p64493
aS'Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?'
p64494
aS'No.'

p64496
aa(lp64497
S"Do you think I'm someone else?"
p64498
aS'Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?'
p64499
aS"Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
p64500
aS'Growth!'
p64501
aS"Fine, I'll give you her number."
p64502
aS'Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy.'

p64511
aS"Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away!"
p64512
aS"C'mon! This looks good!"
p64513
aS"Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
p64514
aS'Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!'
p64515
aS"Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
p64516
aS'Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.'
p64517
aS'I can see why, nice shirt!'
p64518
aa(lp64519
S"You're wearing the same shirt."

p64522
aS'Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?'
p64523
aS'Yeah. Just weird, you know. It\'s like: "Hi, I\'m Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"'
p64524
aS"Uh, we're gonna be great."
p64525
aS"You're gonna be great."
p64526
aS'Well... obviously!'

p64534
aS'Ok.'
p64535
aS"So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D."
p64536
aS"That's what our friends call us."
p64537
aS"Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating."
p64538
aS"I don't know about that."
p64539
aS"You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?"
p64540
aa(lp64541
S"I don't think that's exactly..."
p64542
aS'Let her finish, doctor.'
p64543
aS'Hey!'
p64544
aS'Hey.'
p64545
aS'Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.'
p64546
aS'Well...'
p64547
aS"Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?"
p64548
aS'Nope.'
p64549
aS"What are you talking about? Sarah's great!"
p64550
aS"Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere..."
p64551
aa(lp64552
S'That\xe2\x80\x99s it? That\xe2\x80\x99s why you won\xe2\x80\x99t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!'
p64553
aS'Hey, hey, look! It\xe2\x80\x99s not about a few fries... it\xe2\x80\x99s about what the fries represent.'
p64554
aS'What?'
p64555
aS'ALL FOOD!'
p64556
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!'
p64557
aS'Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don\xe2\x80\x99t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to lose some fingers!'
p64558
aS'Oh'
p64559
aS'Hi'
p64560
aS'Thank God you\xe2\x80\x99re here. Listen to this!'

aa(lp64563
S'Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...'
p64564
aS'Oh! Oh, no!'
p64565
aS'What? You know about the plate thing?'
p64566
aS'Oh, yeah. Joey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...'
p64567
aS'You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her have a grape?'
p64568
aS'Oh no! Not me! Emma!'
p64569
aS'JOEY DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T SHARE FOOD!'
p64570
aS'Well, I still think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!'
p64571
aS'I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I\xe2\x80\x99ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?'
p64572
aS'This place is awesome!'
p64573
aa(lp64574
S'You know, we should just go, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!'
p64575
aS'Ah, this place is great!'
p64576
aS'Wow!'
p64577
aS'Rach, come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .'
p64578
aS'Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!'
p64579
aS'Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?'
p64580
aS'Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!'
p64581
aS'Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.'
p64582
aS'Hey, check this out! It\xe2\x80\x99s totally you!'
p64583
aS'Wow!'
p64584
aa(lp64585
S'Yeah!'

p64587
aS'What? They will be!'
p64588
aS'All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting out of here.'
p64589
aS'No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s other stuff. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...'
p64590
aS'Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.'
p64591
aS'Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I\xe2\x80\x99m... I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.'
p64592
aS'Really?'
p64593
aS'Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she\xe2\x80\x99s gonna go nuts for you.'
p64594
aS'So, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?'
p64595
aa(lp64596
S'Why do men keep talking to me like this?'
p64597
aS'So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s a reverend, that\xe2\x80\x99s important to you?'
p64598
aS'Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought \xe2\x80\x9cwho better then a minister to raise a child!\xe2\x80\x9d'
p64599
aS'Amen.'
p64600
aS'Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!'
p64601
aS'Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.'
p64602
aS'Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?'
p64603
aS'It says \xe2\x80\x9cDo it!\xe2\x80\x9d. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.'
p64604
aS'Wow.'
p64605
aS'Yeah, wow.'
p64606
aa(lp64607
S'I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?'
p64608
aS'Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.'
p64609
aS'Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.'
p64610
aS'No-ot for me it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p64611
aS'So, how\xe2\x80\x99s everything going in here?'
p64612
aS'We\xe2\x80\x99re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.'
p64613
aS'Do you have any question for Erica?'
p64614
aS'Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?'
p64615
aS'Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of it.'
p64616
aS'You should be. You\xe2\x80\x99re really on top of stuff..'
p64617
aa(lp64618
S'Well, then if there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.'
p64619
aS'Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have to.'
p64620
aS'We don\xe2\x80\x99t?'
p64621
aS"Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them."
p64622
aS'Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?'
p64623
aS'Yeah, I did.'
p64624
aS'Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!'
p64625
aS'We got some really great stuff!'
p64626
aS"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got."
p64627
aS'Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?'
p64628
aa(lp64629
S"Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
p64630
aS"Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by"
p64631
aS'oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.'
p64632
aS'So? What do you think?'
p64633
aS'I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!'
p64634
aS"Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here."
p64635
aS"Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that."
p64636
aS'Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?'
p64637
aS'Looks like someone IS the ladies!!'
p64638
aS"You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!"
p64639
aa(lp64640
S'We are NOT signing those papers.'
p64641
aS'Why not?'
p64642
aS"It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else."
p64643
aS'God works in mysterious ways.'
p64644
aS'You have gotta stop!'
p64645
aS'But she liked us.'
p64646
aS'She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.'
p64647
aS'Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.'
p64648
aS'Your Veal Chop is $34,95!'
p64649
aS"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
p64650
aa(lp64651
S'But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?'
p64652
aS'Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.'
p64653
aS'I know..'
p64654
aS"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
p64655
aS'oh, honey..'
p64656
aS'Please.. please, we are so close.'
p64657
aS"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to."
p64658
aS'okay, right.'
p64659
aS"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
p64660
aS"Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?"
p64661
aa(lp64662
S"You're Jewish."
p64663
aS'Technicality!'
p64664
aS'A garden salad for the lady'

p64666
aS'Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!'
p64667
aS'Mmmh, those fries look delicious.'
p64668
aS"oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours."
p64669
aS'Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?'
p64670
aS'Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.'
p64671

p64672
aa(lp64673
S'They are delicious'
p64674
aS'You are beautiful, you know that?'

aS'Oh  okay..'
p64677
aS'NOW look what you did!!'
p64678
aS'What? what is the matter with you?'
p64679
aS"I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
p64680
aS'But you just said "What\'s mine is yours"?'
p64681
aS"WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!"
p64682
aS"Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal."
p64683
aa(lp64684
S"I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do ."
p64685
aS'Wow, this place looks great.'
p64686
aS"Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
p64687
aS'Me too!'
p64688
aS'Here  So this was fun!'
p64689
aS'I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.'
p64690
aS'Sure  Just not as much as clams.'
p64691
aS'Well, stuffed clams.'
p64692
aS'Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.'
p64693
aS'Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.'
p64694
aa(lp64695
S"Yes, that's Raspberry coule."
p64696
aS'So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to'
p64697
aS'Oh my God!'

aS"Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead."
p64699
aS"Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece."
p64700
aS'Mmmm! Mmm!'
p64701
aS'Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?'
p64702
aS'Oh yeah, sure. No problem.'
p64703
aS"What are you doing? I thought you don't share food."
p64704
aS'Sure I do.  Coule?'
p64705
aa(lp64706
S"No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street."
p64707
aS'Really?'
p64708
aS'Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.'
p64709
aS'Yeah, of course. I can control myself.'
p64710
aS'Stop staring at me!'
p64711
aS'Why, just a tiny little...'

p64716
aa(lp64717
S'Hey.'
p64718
aS"So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it."
p64719
aS'I-Is... Is that a picture?'
p64720
aS"Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it."
p64721
aS'Look, doctor!'
p64722
aS"I don't understand."
p64723
aS"The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor."
p64724
aS'What?'
p64725
aS"That's impossible."
p64726
aS"I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like."
p64727
aa(lp64728
S"I'll go check your file. Excuse me."
p64729
aS'So who are you?'
p64730
aS"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
p64731
aS'Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.'
p64732
aS'So you lied to me before?'
p64733
aS'Well, we...  "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.'
p64734
aS"I can't believe this."
p64735
aS'But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...'
p64736
aS"Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?"
p64737
aS"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
p64738
aa(lp64739
S"I don't want to look at your file! This is over."
p64740
aS'Erica wait!'
p64741
aS"I've nothing to say to you."
p64742
aS"You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again."
p64743
aS"Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?"
p64744
aS"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
p64745
aS"Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong."
p64746
aS"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
p64747
aS'You still want that baby?'
p64748
aS'God bless you Chandler Bing!'

aa(lp64750
S'Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.'
p64751
aS'So, why are you still wearing it?'
p64752
aS"Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?"
p64753
aS'Ooh... Not so good.'
p64754
aS"Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?"
p64755
aS'Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.'
p64756

p64757
aS'Mmh... this cake is amazing!'
p64758
aS'My God, get a room!'
p64759

p64760
aa(lp64761
S'If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?'
p64762
aS'Sex!'
p64763
aS'Seriously, answer faster!'
p64764
aS'Oh, I\'m sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn\'t thinking about "sex with you"!'
p64765
aS"It's like a giant hug."
p64766
aS'Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?'
p64767
aS'Food.'
p64768
aS'Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?'
p64769
aS"Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice."
p64770
aS'Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?'
p64771
aa(lp64772
S"Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard."
p64773
aS'No, you gotta pick one!'
p64774
aS"Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!"
p64775

p64776
aS'Oh, how cute!'
p64777
aS'Yeah.'
p64778

p64779
aS'Oh, no, no. That is a doll.'
p64780

p64782
aa(lp64783
S"OH! He's having an affair."
p64784
aS"He's not having an affair!"
p64785
aS"You know, I'm always right about these things."
p64786
aS"No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!"
p64787
aS"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
p64788
aS"Oh, that doesn't mean anything."
p64789
aS"Oh yeah? Well, let's see.  Ok, duck down."
p64790
aS'Hello.'
p64791
aS"Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel."
p64792
aS"Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
p64793
aa(lp64794
S'Oh, well, it\'s a shame that you-that you miss the movie \'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".'
p64795
aS'Those are all really old!'
p64796
aS"Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
p64797
aS'"Dude, Where\'s My Car?"'
p64798
aS'What?'
p64799
aS"They're in a caaar..."
p64800
aS"Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye."
p64801
aS'Geez!'
p64802
aS'Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.'
p64803
aS'Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.'
p64804
aa(lp64805
S'I got them!'
p64806
aS'Hi!'
p64807
aS'Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.'
p64808
aS'I was in the car with Nancy all day.'
p64809
aS'Nancy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smoke!'
p64810
aS'Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!'
p64811
aS'So? What do you think of the house?'
p64812
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for.'
p64813
aS'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?'
p64814
aS'And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?'
p64815
aa(lp64816
S'Don\xe2\x80\x99t you love the huge yard?'
p64817
aS'And the fireplace in the bedroom.'
p64818
aS"And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
p64819
aS'This is bringing out a lovely color in you!'
p64820
aS'So? Do you think we should get it?'
p64821
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you think?'
p64822
aS'I think we should.'
p64823
aS'I do too.'
p64824
aS'This is huge!'
p64825
aS'I know.'
p64826
aa(lp64827
S'How bad you wanna smoke, right now.'
p64828
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.'
p64829
aS'Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?'
p64830
aS"We don\xe2\x80\x99t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
p64831
aS'Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.'
p64832
aS'I know. Gooooood luck with it.'
p64833
aS'I just can\xe2\x80\x99t see Chandler cheating!'
p64834
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!'
p64835
aS'Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he would do this to Monica!'
p64836
aS'I know, and with the baby coming?'
p64837
aa(lp64838
S'So, should we tell her?'
p64839
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?'
p64840
aS'Why? Who\xe2\x80\x99d you seen him with?'
p64841
aS'No one, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying if...'
p64842
aS'TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!'
p64843
aS'I know nothing! Mike\xe2\x80\x99s a great guy, it was hypothetical!'
p64844
aS'All right. . He is a good guy. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat.'
p64845
aS'Believe me, if I did see with someone, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I...'
p64846
aS'WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?'
p64847
aS'Oh, look at her, so happy!'
p64848
aa(lp64849
S'If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!'
p64850
aS'Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?'
p64851
aS'No, he\xe2\x80\x99s picking up dinner, why, what\xe2\x80\x99s up?'
p64852
aS'Well, look, whatever happens, we\xe2\x80\x99re here for you and we love you.'
p64853
aS'All right...'
p64854
aS'We think Chandler might be having an affair.'
p64855
aS'What?'
p64856
aS'Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.'
p64857
aS'They went in together. So sorry.'
p64858
aS'Oh my God! Oh my God that\xe2\x80\x99s awful! What did you think of the house?'
p64859
aa(lp64860
S'What?'
p64861
aS'Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?'
p64862
aS"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?"
p64863
aS'Hey!'
p64864
aS'You son of a bitch!'
p64865
aS'Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?'
p64866
aS"Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair."
p64867
aS"Who's Nancy?"
p64868
aS"What's going on?"
p64869
aS"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
p64870
aa(lp64871
S"Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor."
p64872
aS"I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!"
p64873
aS'Why do you have a realtor?'
p64874
aS'Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.'
p64875
aS'What?'
p64876
aS'Are you serious?'
p64877
aS"When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
p64878
aS"So you're gonna move?"
p64879
aS'Oh my God.'
p64880
aS"Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!"
p64881
aa(lp64882
S"What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
p64883
aS"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
p64884
aS'...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.'
p64885
aS"So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?"
p64886
aS"Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?"
p64887
aS"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
p64888
aS"No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you!"
p64889
aS"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
p64890
aS'Actually, we already found a house we love.'
p64891
aS'What?'
p64892
aa(lp64893
S'And about an hour ago, we made an offer.'
p64894
aS'Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?'
p64895
aS'You put an offer on a house?'
p64896
aS"It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees..."
p64897
aS'Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?'
p64898
aS"I know this is really hard and we're really sorry."
p64899
aS'Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!'
p64900
aS"You know that's not the reason Joe."
p64901
aS"We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?"
p64902
aS'Yeah it is.'
p64903
aa(lp64904
S"What the hell are you doin'?"
p64905
aS"Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!"
p64906
aS'Yeah, but so is this.'
p64907
aS'Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?'
p64908
aS"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
p64909
aS"You can see where he'd have trouble."
p64910
aS"Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica."
p64911
aS"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
p64912
aS'That money is mine, Green!'
p64913
aS"You're fly is open, Geller!"
p64914
aa(lp64915
S"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
p64916
aS"Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
p64917
aS'Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.'
p64918
aS'Ow, that had to hurt!'
p64919
aS"Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
p64920
aS'We will.'
p64921
aS'Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.'
p64922
aS'No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.'
p64923
aS'Every year.'
p64924
aS"It's stuck!!!"
p64925
aa(lp64926
S'Easy. Step. How did it get on?'
p64927
aS'I put it on to scare Chandler!'
p64928
aS"Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!"
p64929
aS'It smells really bad in here.'
p64930
aS"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!"
p64931
aS'Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?'
p64932
aS"It's Joey."
p64933
aS'I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?'
p64934

She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she\xe2\x80\x99ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I\xe2\x80\x99d like.'

aS'Sure!'
p65016
aS'What the hell is that dog doing here?!'
p65017
aS"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
p65018
aS"That's so sweet."
p65019
aS"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
p65020

p65026
aS"You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good."
p65027
aS"Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night."
p65028
aS"Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
p65029
aS'And?'
p65030

aS'Totally. I had sex in High school...'
p65139
aS"Me too. I'm good at it."

aS"All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."

S'Oh, oh... maybe not you!'
p65147
aS'Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.'

aa(lp65168
S"You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
p65169
aS"Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that."
p65170
aS"Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!"
p65171
aS"Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party."
p65172
aS"Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?"
p65173
aS"Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!"
p65174
aS'Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.'

aS"Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away."
p65204
aS"And we're out!"
p65205
aS"Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?"
p65206
aS"Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!"
p65207
aS"Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!"
p65208
aS"Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you."
p65209

p65210
aS'So, Saturday night!'
p65211
aa(lp65212
S"I'd love to!"
p65213
aS'Great!'
p65214
aS'So how come it took you so long to ask me out?'
p65215
aS'Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?'
p65216
aS'Sure, he was in your "band"?'
p65217
aS"It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt."
p65218
aS'Sorry.'
p65219
aS"That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
p65220
aS'Really?'
p65221
aS'Yeah, why?'
p65222
aa(lp65223
S'Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!'

S"That's right, it's officer Goodbody."
p65235
aS"What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?"
p65236
aS"Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!"
p65237
aS"Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch."
p65238
aS'Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...'
p65239
aS'Goodbody!'
p65240
aS'...If-you-say-so.'
p65241
aS"So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take  downtown!"
p65242

S'Rachel?'
p65246
aS'Yeah?'
p65247
aS'Are you kidding?'
p65248
aS'All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!'
p65249
aS'How old is your phonebook?'
p65250
aS'Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!'
p65251
aS"Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"

p65255
aa(lp65256
S'Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!'
p65257
aS"This is how I look when I'm turned on!"
p65258
aS"You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat?  Look, I've been in this business for a long time!"
p65259
aS'Shocking!'
p65260
aS"Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!"
p65261
aS'Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?'
p65262
aS"No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
p65263
aS"No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
p65264
aS"Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!"
p65265
aS"I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this."
p65266
aa(lp65267
S"Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory."
p65268
aS"Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!"
p65269
aS"I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man."
p65270
aS"I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
p65271
aS"Oh, you're mean!"
p65272
aS'Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...'

p65279
aS'Uvula!'
p65280
aS'Oh, then pass.'
p65281
aS"O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars!  And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani"
p65282
aS'You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?'
p65283
aS"Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!"
p65284
aS'You broke the pact!'
p65285
aS'Ross, that was 16 years ago!'
p65286
aS"That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship."
p65287
aS"I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
p65288

aa(lp65300
S"I don't know what... you're talking about."
p65301
aS'Really?'
p65302
aS'Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.'
p65303
aS"I can't believe we are at a real college party!  I have to pee so bad!"
p65304
aS'This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!'
p65305
aS"Hey, you've got a boyfriend!"
p65306
aS"I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!"
p65307
aS"Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!"

aS'Hi Monica.'
p65317
aS"Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you  NOT."
p65318
aS"O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross."
p65319
aS'Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.'
p65320
aS'Oh.'
p65321
aa(lp65322
S"Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days."
p65323
aS"Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this."
p65324
aS"Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this."
p65325
aS'Cool!'
p65326
aS"I didn't know you knew about that."
p65327
aS'Well, I did and it hurt.  That\'s when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".'
p65328
aS"Man... I... I'm sorry."
p65329
aS'Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.'
p65330
aS"So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even."
p65331
aS'Hmm mmmhm..'
p65332
aa(lp65333
S'We are even, right?'
p65334
aS'Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?'
p65335
aS'What did you do to my mom?'
p65336
aS'Not her!'
p65337
aS'I am sooo drunk.'
p65338
aS"That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all."
p65339
aS'Soo... you girls having fun?'
p65340
aS"For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing."
p65341
aS'SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?'
p65342
aS'Oh THATS ME!'
p65343
aa(lp65344
S'I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.'
p65345
aS'Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.'
p65346
aS"Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?"
p65347
aS'Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.'
p65348
aS'Oh, what a line.'
p65349
aS'So where are you applying to?'
p65350
aS"Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of...   Hey!"
p65351
aS"I'm in college and I'm in a band."
p65352
aS'Yeah okay.'
p65353
aS"What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?"
p65354
aa(lp65355
S"You know, it's fine. We'll pay you."
p65356
aS"No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know."
p65357
aS"No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?"
p65358
aS"I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame."
p65359
aS'So maybe something in an office.'

aS"You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind."
p65362
aS"There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?"
p65363
aS"Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it."

p65404
aS'Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?'
p65405
aS'What? When was this?'
p65406
aS'Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.'
p65407
aS"Oh my God! That's wild!"
p65408
aS"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
p65409
aa(lp65410
S'Well, it matters to me.'
p65411
aS'Why?'
p65412
aS'Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.'
p65413
aS'You kissed her that night too?'
p65414
aS'Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.'
p65415
aS'Seriously, where did this happen?'
p65416
aS'Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.'
p65417
aS'Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?'
p65418
aS'Mine.'
p65419
aS"I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed."
p65420
aa(lp65421
S'No, she was definitely on my bed.'
p65422
aS'Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?'
p65423
aS'Well, then who was on my bed?'
p65424
aS'OH! Oh, oh!'
p65425
aS'NO! No, no!'
p65426
aS'YES!'
p65427
aS'You were under the pile of coats?'
p65428
aS'I was the pile of coats!'
p65429
aS'OH MY GOD!'
p65430
aS'You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?'
p65431
aa(lp65432
S'You were my first kiss with Rachel?'
p65433
aS'You were my first kiss ever?'
p65434
aS'What did I marry into?'
p65435
aS'Oh, crap!'
p65436
aS'Oh, hey Joey.'
p65437
aS'Uh, hey.'
p65438
aS"Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
p65439
aS'Yeah.'
p65440
aS"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday."
p65441
aS"So he can't come?"
p65442
aa(lp65443
S"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it."
p65444
aS'Seriously?'
p65445
aS"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
p65446
aS'I am pretty wisdomous.'
p65447
aS'So... what do you say?'
p65448
aS'Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.'
p65449
aS'Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.'
p65450
aS"Listen, I hope... that you know...  I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
p65451
aS'Oh.'
p65452
aS'Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.'
p65453
aa(lp65454
S"Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!  Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!"
p65455
aS'Well, it matters to me!'
p65456
aS"Well, I don't care, so you pick!"
p65457
aS'Did you just hung up on me?  All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.'
p65458
aS'Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.'
p65459
aS"You don't know military time?"
p65460
aS'Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.'
p65461
aS'Just subtract twelve.'
p65462
aS'Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...'
p65463
aS"Six o'clock!"
p65464
aa(lp65465
S'Ok.'
p65466
aS"Ok. Hold on.  Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
p65467
aS'Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.'
p65468
aS'Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.'
p65469
aS'What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.'
p65470
aS'Ooh... she backed out.'
p65471
aS'She did? Why?'
p65472
aS'I made her.  Steel drums don\'t really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie\'s overwhelming scent.'
p65473
aS'Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.'
p65474
aS'Hey!'
p65475
aa(lp65476
S'Hey!'
p65477
aS"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them."
p65478
aS'Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?'
p65479
aS'No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.'
p65480
aS'Rehearse it!'
p65481
aS'Hi!'
p65482
aS'Thanks for coming you guys.'
p65483
aS'Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.'
p65484
aS'Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?'
p65485
aS'That is why!'
p65486
aa(lp65487
S'Yeah.'
p65488
aS'So Rach.'
p65489
aS'Yeah.'
p65490
aS'Where is Emma?'
p65491
aS"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix."
p65492
aS'Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!'
p65493
aS"Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?"
p65494
aS'Yes, we are.'
p65495
aS'Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?'
p65496
aS"How's that?"
p65497
aa(lp65498
S"You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go."
p65499
aS"Who in God's name are you?"
p65500
aS"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!"
p65501
aS"You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow."
p65502
aS"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?"
p65503
aS'Uh... November?'
p65504
aS"I wanna say it's not looking good."
p65505
aS'Hey Pheebs...'
p65506
aS"What's up?"
p65507
aS"Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet."
p65508
aa(lp65509
S'Heh.'
p65510
aS"Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding."
p65511
aS'What?'
p65512
aS'Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!'
p65513
aS"I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut."
p65514
aS'Oh, man!'
p65515
aS'This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!'
p65516
aS'FOOTBALL!'
p65517
aS'Thank you.'
p65518
aS'Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.'
p65519
aa(lp65520
S'Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!'
p65521
aS'Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!'
p65522
aS"I don't have a fax machine."
p65523
aS'Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!'
p65524
aS"I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding."
p65525
aS'I know, I hate being left out of things.'
p65526
aS"And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it..."
p65527
aS'Hey guys, how is it going?'
p65528
aS"Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow."
p65529
aS"Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it."
p65530
aa(lp65531
S'What happened?'
p65532
aS'Who cares, AND?'
p65533
aS'...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...'
p65534
aS"I'll do it!"
p65535
aS'M-Me-me-me!'
p65536
aS"You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one."
p65537
aS'Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.'
p65538
aS'No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?'
p65539
aS"You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose."
p65540
aS"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman."
p65541
aa(lp65542
S'Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!'
p65543
aS"Please, you're going down!"
p65544
aS'You are going downer!'
p65545
aS'Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?'
p65546
aS"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!"
p65547
aS"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
p65548
aS'Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.'
p65549
aS'Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?'
p65550
aS'I intend to marry her.'
p65551
aS"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?"
p65552
aa(lp65553
S'No more so than acting.'
p65554
aS'Strike two!'
p65555
aS"You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?"
p65556
aS'Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!'
p65557
aS'So, what did you decide?'
p65558
aS'I decided to pee.'
p65559
aS"Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out."
p65560
aS"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!"
p65561
aS'Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.'
p65562
aS"Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today."
p65563
aa(lp65564
S'Goody, what is it!'
p65565
aS"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that."
p65566
aS"What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that."
p65567
aS"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid."
p65568
aS"I'll do it!"
p65569
aS"Ok, it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast."
p65570
aS'Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?'
p65571
aS'You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!'
p65572
aS'Is that what you say to Chandler?'
p65573
aS"It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say."
p65574
aa(lp65575
S"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here..."
p65576
aS'oh God.'
p65577
aS"And... moment's over!  So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm...  Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS  OR THIS  OR THIS  OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS!  You know what? You're done."
p65578
aS'What?'
p65579
aS"YOU'RE FIRED!   Cheers!"
p65580
aS'Hey!'
p65581
aS'Happy wedding day!'
p65582
aS'Oh, happy my wedding day to you!'
p65583
aS"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages."
p65584
aS"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!"
p65585
aa(lp65586
S"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back."
p65587
aS"Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid."
p65588
aS"Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages."
p65589
aS'Wow, this is a lot!'
p65590
aS"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine."
p65591
aS'You won awards?'
p65592
aS'Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.'
p65593
aS'Hey!'
p65594
aS'Hi.'
p65595
aS"Where's Rach?"
p65596
aa(lp65597
S"She's in her room, why?"
p65598
aS"I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!"
p65599
aS"What d'you want?"
p65600
aS"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
p65601
aS"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!"
p65602
aS"I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!"
p65603
aS"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!"
p65604
aS"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
p65605
aS'Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!'
p65606
aS'YES, YES!'
p65607
aa(lp65608
S"Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?"
p65609
aS'I know.'
p65610
aS'Hey.'
p65611
aS'Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?'
p65612
aS'Orchids?'
p65613
aS"Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!"
p65614
aS'Hello Michael.'
p65615
aS'Joseph.'
p65616
aS'May I have a word with you, please?'
p65617
aS'This is... great...'
p65618
aa(lp65619
S'Have a seat.  Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me...  I cannot allow this.'
p65620
aS'Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?'
p65621
aS'More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."'
p65622
aS'Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?'
p65623
aS'I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.'
p65624
aS"Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her."
p65625
aS"That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
p65626
aS'That must have been one lousy movie.'
p65627
aS'That was ME!'
p65628
aS'Hi'
p65629
aa(lp65630
S"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
p65631
aS"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross."
p65632
aS"Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back."
p65633
aS'All right fine, I pick you.'
p65634
aS'Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.'
p65635
aS'Oh my...'
p65636
aS"No! We're gonna do it my way.  Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend.  Hello?"
p65637
aS"I'm glad we had this little talk."
p65638
aS"Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?"
p65639
aS'Okay.'
p65640
aa(lp65641
S'Bye.'
p65642
aS'Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?'
p65643
aS"Oh my God, what's it doing here?"
p65644
aS'Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.  Uh! What a pickle.'
p65645
aS'Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?'
p65646
aS'How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?'
p65647
aS"How's it going?"
p65648
aS"Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding."
p65649
aS"That's what I was doing too."
p65650
aS'Well, you have fun tonight.'
p65651
aa(lp65652
S'You too.'
p65653
aS'Oh, I will.'
p65654
aS'Me too.'
p65655
aS"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?"
p65656
aS"I'm not supposed to tell you."
p65657
aS"I'm not supposed to tell you!"
p65658
aS'You told us both we could be in the wedding?'
p65659
aS'Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.'
p65660
aS'Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.'
p65661
aS'Rach, Rach, knock knock.'
p65662
aa(lp65663
S"Who's there?"
p65664
aS"I'll tell you at the wedding."
p65665
aS'Uh.'

aS'Hey, I forgot my scarf.'
p65667
aS"You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick."
p65668
aS"Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy."
p65669
aS'What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.'
p65670
aS"Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog."
p65671
aS"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?"
p65672
aS"How's it going?"
p65673
aa(lp65674
S'Help me.'
p65675
aS'What?'
p65676
aS'I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.'
p65677
aS'Really?'
p65678
aS'Please?'
p65679
aS'You really want me to come back?'
p65680
aS'More than I wanna get married.'
p65681
aS"Ok people, we are back in business!  Oh God, we've missed you soo much!  Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything."
p65682
aS'Hey, what are you guys gonna do?'
p65683
aS'About what?'
p65684
aa(lp65685
S"The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels."
p65686
aS'Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!'
p65687
aS"I don't think they are."
p65688
aS"Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs."
p65689
aS"Well, the club lost it's power."
p65690
aS'Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.'
p65691
aS'Since when do you watch the news?'
p65692
aS'Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.'
p65693
aS"I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today."
p65694
aS'I know.'
p65695
aa(lp65696
S"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?"
p65697
aS'What?'
p65698
aS"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!"
p65699
aS'What do you think?'
p65700
aS'I think I wanna get married to you today.'
p65701
aS'Me too!  Monica, do you think we could do it?'
p65702
aS'AFFIRMATIVE!'
p65703
aS"OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.  Okay, who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE?"
p65704
aS'Michael!'
p65705
aS"Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi!  Hi!  Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of..."
p65706
aa(lp65707
S"No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever."
p65708
aS'I crushed a pill and put it in her drink...  Come on, sweetheart.'
p65709
aS"You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle."
p65710
aS'So technically, would this person be in the wedding?'
p65711
aS'I guess.'
p65712
aS"I'll do it!"
p65713
aS"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?"
p65714
aS"I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED."
p65715
aS"Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!"
p65716
aS"Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it."
p65717
aa(lp65718
S'Oh, no!'
p65719
aS"Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding."
p65720
aS'Really?'
p65721
aS"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh..."
p65722
aS"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free."
p65723
aS'I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.'
p65724
aS'Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.'
p65725
aS"I'll do it."
p65726
aS"I'll..."
p65727
aS'Na ha ha...  Ne he he...  Ah ah...'
p65728
aa(lp65729
S'Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.'
p65730
aS"Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away."
p65731
aS'Oh, okay. Hi new dad.'
p65732
aS"So, you're ready to do this?"
p65733
aS'Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.'
p65734
aS"Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey."
p65735
aS'Oh, thank you.'
p65736
aS'I love you.  Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.'
p65737
aS'I love you guys.'
p65738
aS'I love you.'
p65739
aa(lp65740
S"Okay.  It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count.  Let's get this bad boy on the road."
p65741
aS'Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?'
p65742
aS'I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.'
p65743
aS'Oh yeah!'
p65744
aS'Okay Marjorie, hit it.'
p65745
aS'Geez Ross, you could have showered.'
p65746
aS"It's the dog."
p65747
aS"Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down!  Oh, that's me."
p65748
aS'Ready?'
p65749
aS'Okay.'
p65750
aa(lp65751
S'Okay.'
p65752
aS'Oh wait, oh no. Wait.'
p65753
aS"Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?"
p65754
aS"I don't care... I'll be my something blue."
p65755
aS'You look beautiful.'
p65756
aS'Thank you.'
p65757
aS"My God! Aren't you freezing?"
p65758
aS'Na-ah.'
p65759
aS"Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?"
p65760
aS'Okay...'
p65761
aa(lp65762
S"When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family."
p65763
aS"Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever."
p65764
aS'Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.'
p65765
aS'I love you too.'
p65766
aS'Uh Joey...'
p65767
aS'Yeah?'
p65768
aS"Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down."
p65769
aS'Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?'
p65770
aS'I do.'
p65771
aS'Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?'
p65772
aa(lp65773
S'I do.'
p65774
aS'I now pronounce you... husband and wife.'
p65775
aS"I got married!  Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing."
p65776
aS'That really was an incredible wedding.'
p65777
aS"It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?"
p65778
aS"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
p65779
aS'Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?'
p65780
aS"I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to."
p65781
aS'Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.'
p65782
aS'Hi'
p65783
aa(lp65784
S'Hey! Hi!'
p65785
aS'How was the honeymoon?'
p65786
aS'Oh!'
p65787
aS"So, where's Mike?"
p65788
aS"Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!"
p65789
aS"Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help."
p65790
aS"Oh, why? What's up?"
p65791
aS"I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, I'm fluent in."
p65792
aS"Joey, you shouldn't lie on your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9."
p65793
aS"Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?"
p65794
aa(lp65795
S'It was ok...'
p65796
aS'I did not know you spoke French.'
p65797
aS"Oui, bien sur je parle Fran\xc3\xa7ais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?"
p65798
aS"Oh... you're so sexy!"
p65799
aS'Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.'
p65800
aS'Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.'

aS'Why are you wearing my apron?'
p65805
aa(lp65806
S"I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour."
p65807
aS'Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who\'s carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?'
p65808
aS'Hey.'
p65809
aS'Hey.'
p65810
aS'You guys know where Rachel is?'
p65811
aS"No, we haven't seen her since this morning."
p65812
aS'So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.'
p65813
aS'Hey!'
p65814
aS'Hey!'
p65815
aS'These are for Erica!'
p65816
aa(lp65817
S"What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?"
p65818
aS'Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!'
p65819
aS'So, why is Erica coming to visit?'
p65820
aS"Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building..."
p65821
aS'Oh, those places! There\'s always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there\'s always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!'
p65822
aS'Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?'
p65823
aS'Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!'
p65824
aS'Ross...'
p65825
aS"No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?"
p65826
aS'My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney\xe2\x80\x99s.'
p65827
aa(lp65828
S'Oh my God.'
p65829
aS'Honey.'
p65830
aS"I'm so sorry..."
p65831
aS'Is-is he ok?'
p65832
aS"Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated."
p65833
aS"Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now."
p65834
aS"No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own."
p65835
aS'Still-still, let me come... for me.'
p65836
aS'Ok. If you really need to.'
p65837
aS"I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies."
p65838
aa(lp65839
S'Oh, I really could.'
p65840
aS'Oh!'
p65841
aS'Ohh...'

p65881
aS'Can somebody please go in?'
p65882
aa(lp65883
S'Absolutely.'
p65884

p65886
aS"I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!"

p65889
aS'Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?'

p65942
aS'Yeah.'
p65943
aS'You had a rough day, uh?'

aS"Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!"

p65948
aa(lp65949
S'What?'
p65950

p65963
aS"Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea."
p65964
aS"Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
p65965
aS"No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
p65966
aS"Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
p65967
aS"Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!"

aS'Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.'
p65985
aS"That's great."
p65986
aS"Yeah... it's almost definitely him."
p65987
aS"How's that now?"
p65988
aS"Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped."
p65989
aS'So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?'
p65990
aS"No, he's in prison."
p65991
aS'Was he falsely accused of something?'
p65992
aa(lp65993

aS'Are you awake?'
p65996
aS"Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!"
p65997
aS"Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy."
p65998
aS"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer."
p65999
aS'Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?'
p66000
aS"I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is."
p66001
aS'How?'
p66002
aS"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
p66003
aa(lp66004
S"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."
p66005
aS'Pff, easy for you to say, he\'s a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He\'s probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!'
p66006
aS'We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.'
p66007
aS'Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!'
p66008
aS'Good job.'
p66009
aS'Thank you.'
p66010
aS'Hey Joey.'
p66011
aS'Hey!'
p66012
aS'Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.'
p66013
aS"Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!"
p66014
aa(lp66015
S'Really, can I hear some of it.'
p66016
aS'Sure, sure. Ok,  "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"  See?'
p66017
aS"Well, you're not,  You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!"
p66018
aS"Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
p66019
aS'How could you possibly think that?'
p66020
aS'For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!'
p66021
aS'Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?'
p66022
aS'Sure.'
p66023
aS"You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?"
p66024
aS'Hmm-hmm.'
p66025
aa(lp66026
S"You sure you're alright?"
p66027
aS'Yep.'
p66028

p66029
aS'FYI..'
p66030
aS'There it is...'
p66031
aS'In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.'
p66032
aS"Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing."
p66033
aS"Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
p66034
aS'Well...'
p66035
aS'Oh stop that!'
p66036
aa(lp66037
S"I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding."
p66038
aS'Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)'
p66039
aS'Hey, I was looking out for you.'
p66040
aS"Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me."
p66041
aS'I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.'
p66042
aS"Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either."
p66043
aS"Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again."
p66044
aS'What?'
p66045
aS"That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?"
p66046
aS'Hey! How was lunch?'
p66047
aa(lp66048
S'We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob'
p66049
aS'Oh, really?'
p66050
aS"No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing."
p66051
aS'O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?'
p66052
aS"Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is."
p66053
aS"Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?"
p66054
aS"No it's not."
p66055
aS'How do you know?'
p66056
aS"Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way."
p66057
aS'Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?'
p66058
aa(lp66059
S'The thing we never do.'
p66060
aS'Shovely Joe!'
p66061
aS"Whenever you're ready Joey."

aS'You know what. I think this audition is over.'
p66068
aS'Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regin\xc3\xa9 Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Est\xc3\xa9e Lauder.'
p66069

p66073
aS'Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...'
p66074
aS"Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part."
p66075
aS'Ah. All right. But my French was good?'
p66076
aS'It was great.'
p66077
aS'Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!'

aS'Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.'
p66085
aS'Oh, no problem.'
p66086
aS"And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again."
p66087
aS"Thank you. I'm glad you agree."
p66088
aS"It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."
p66089
aS"Yeah... Yeah, that's true."
p66090

p66099
aS'Not even once.'

aS'Even if we want it really bad.'
p66102

p66104
aS'Uhm, right!'
p66105
aS"...It's kinda hard though!"
p66106
aS'Yeah.'
p66107
aS"You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste."

p66129
aS'Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.'
p66130
aS"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
p66131
aS'Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.'
p66132
aS"You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
p66133
aS'Hey, you guys... I have great news.'

p66163
aS'Here you go.'
p66164

p66173
aS"All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
p66174
aS"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
p66175
aS"But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map."
p66176
aS'Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.'

p66183
aS'Good for you. That was really mature.'
p66184
aS"What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
p66185
aS"You're a strange kind of grown-up."
p66186
aS"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just..."
p66187
aS'Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?'
p66188
aS'All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.'

p66190
aa(lp66191
S'I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!'

p66223
aa(lp66224

p66230
aS'It can be anything you want.'
p66231

p66243

aS'That is a bad interview.'
p66255
aS'What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?'
p66256
aa(lp66257
S'Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he\'s gonna have to let me go, because I\'m not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.'
p66258

aS'What?'
p66297
aS'Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.'
p66298

p66299
aS'Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.'
p66300
aa(lp66301
S"Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here."
p66302

p66307
aS"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here."
p66308

p66322
aa(lp66323
S'You really did that?'
p66324
aS'Yep.'
p66325
aS"Yeah, but you can't do that."
p66326
aS"Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
p66327
aS"Alright, then I'm gonna change my name."
p66328
aS'Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?'
p66329
aS'Crap Bag.'
p66330
aS'Mike Crap Bag?'
p66331
aS'No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.'
p66332
aS"You're not serious, right?"
p66333
aa(lp66334
S"Yeah, I'm serious.  It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!"
p66335
aS'Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.'
p66336
aS'I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.'
p66337
aS'And I love Crap.'
p66338
aS'Ow!'
p66339
aS'Who are you?'
p66340
aS"Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?"
p66341
aS"I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house."
p66342
aS'Oh.'
p66343
aS'I hate my parents.'
p66344
aa(lp66345
S"I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening."
p66346
aS'Like what?'
p66347
aS'Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!'
p66348
aS'What are you? Eight?'
p66349
aS"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea."
p66350
aS"I don't have any great ideas. I am eight."
p66351
aS"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
p66352
aS"I really don't."
p66353
aS"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
p66354
aS"My parents say I'm gonna make new friends."
p66355
aa(lp66356
S"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways."
p66357
aS'This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?'
p66358
aS'Yeah, yeah, I guess.'
p66359
aS"Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?"
p66360
aS'Yeah, maybe.'
p66361
aS'Then you gotta let them go.'
p66362
aS"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?"
p66363
aS'I read a lot.'
p66364
aS'Just when I thought we could be friends.'
p66365
aS"Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry."
p66366
aa(lp66367
S'Oh, thank you...'
p66368
aS"You still don't know my name, do you?"
p66369
aS"Well, now I don't have to."
p66370
aS'Ross, what is taking you so long?'
p66371
aS"I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!"
p66372
aS'Rachel?'
p66373
aS'Mark? Oh my God!'
p66374
aS"How've you been?"
p66375
aS"I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?"
p66376
aS"Sure, sure.  What's with the chair."
p66377
aa(lp66378
S"Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so..."
p66379
aS'Clever.  So how are you?'
p66380
aS"Oh, well,  you're not catching me on my best day."
p66381
aS"Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion."
p66382
aS"No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work."
p66383
aS'Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.'
p66384
aS"Well, screw charity work. What've you got?"
p66385
aS"Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?"
p66386
aS"Great! I'll call ya!"
p66387
aS'Nice to see you.'
p66388
aa(lp66389
S'Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!'
p66390
aS'Oh my God!'
p66391
aS"See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?"
p66392
aS"Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him."
p66393
aS'That is Mark?'
p66394
aS'Yes.'
p66395
aS'I hate that guy.'
p66396
aS'Oh.'
p66397
aS'No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.'
p66398
aS"What? You don't want me to get a job?"
p66399
aa(lp66400
S"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary."
p66401
aS'Ugh.'
p66402
aS"I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?"
p66403
aS"Ross, you know what?  Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security."
p66404
aS'Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.'
p66405
aS'Man, those two dogs are going at it!'
p66406
aS'Hey!'
p66407
aS'Hey.'
p66408
aS'Hey, where have you been?'
p66409
aS'Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.'
p66410
aa(lp66411
S'Really? What changed your mind?'
p66412
aS'Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.'
p66413
aS'Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.'
p66414
aS'What?'
p66415
aS"Ha! I'm just messing with you."
p66416
aS"That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!"
p66417
aS"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
p66418
aS'What? I get my own room?'
p66419
aS"You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?"
p66420
aS'Oh my God!  Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?'
p66421
aa(lp66422
S'No!'
p66423
aS"Why not? I'll keep the tank clean."
p66424
aS'After you, miss Banana Hammock.'
p66425
aS'Thank you, mister Bag.'
p66426
aS'Oh hey, how are you?'
p66427
aS"Oh hi Rita! Good!  Oh, Rita's a massage client."
p66428
aS"Oh! Why don't you introduce me?"
p66429
aS'Er, Rita, this is my husband.'
p66430
aS'Oh!'
p66431
aS'Yeah.'
p66432
aa(lp66433
S"Why don't you tell her my name?"
p66434
aS'Okay, I will.  This is my husband Crap Bag.'
p66435
aS'Crap Bag?'
p66436
aS'If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.'
p66437
aS'Okay. Excuse me...'
p66438
aS'Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?'
p66439
aS"Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay."
p66440
aS'How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?'
p66441
aS'Really?'
p66442
aS"Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock."
p66443
aa(lp66444
S'Do you even know what a banana hammock is?'
p66445
aS"It's a funny word."
p66446
aS"It's a Speedo."
p66447
aS'...Oh crap!'
p66448
aS'Hey, is Rachel here?'
p66449
aS'No.'
p66450
aS"She's still at dinner?"
p66451
aS"I guess. Why? Who's she with?"
p66452
aS"That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her."
p66453
aS"It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!"
p66454
aa(lp66455
S'We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.'
p66456
aS"So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute."
p66457
aS'Excuse me?'
p66458
aS"Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time."
p66459
aS"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents."
p66460
aS'Oh, sorry!'
p66461
aS'Hi you guys!'
p66462
aS'Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?'
p66463
aS'Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.'
p66464
aS'Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?'
p66465
aa(lp66466
S"Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins."
p66467
aS'Should we send something?'
p66468
aS'How did the job stuff go?'
p66469
aS'He offered me one.'
p66470
aS"That's great!"
p66471
aS'Congratulations!'
p66472
aS"I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great..."
p66473
aS"Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest."
p66474
aS'The job is in Paris.'
p66475
aS"I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?"
p66476
aa(lp66477
S"I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on."
p66478

p66480
aS'How did the job stuff go?'
p66481
aS'He offered me one.'
p66482
aS'You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.'
p66483
aS'The job is in Paris.'
p66484
aS'Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something.'
p66485
aS"So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?"
p66486
aS'Or facing a bitch of a commute.'
p66487
aa(lp66488
S"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away   from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already   talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever   we need to make us feel comfortable."
p66489
aS'Okay.'
p66490
aS"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...   Anything we want."
p66491
aS'My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.'
p66492
aS"All right, we'll work it out."
p66493
aS'Thank you! Thank you!'
p66494
aS'Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?'
p66495
aS'I think it is.'

p66501
aS"It's in Paris."
p66502
aS'What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,   okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid   suburbs...'
p66503
aS"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
p66504
aS"Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it."
p66505
aS'Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means   a lot if you could try to get on board.'
p66506
aS'Of course we can. Congratulations.    Yay!  Joey...'
p66507
aS'No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.'
p66508
aS'Joey, it would mean so...'
p66509
aa(lp66510
S'Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.'
p66511
aS'Joey...'
p66512
aS'You okay with this?'
p66513
aS'Well, it makes me feel sad, but...'
p66514
aS'Talking to Ross.'
p66515
aS'I see.'
p66516
aS'Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every   day. How can I be okay with this?'
p66517
aS'I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.'
p66518
aS'Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,   she would take it?'
p66519
aS'How is that gonna happen?'
p66520
aa(lp66521
S'Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?'
p66522
aS"I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas   party. We really hit it off."
p66523
aS'You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?'
p66524
aS"I didn't say we were brothers."
p66525
aS"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next   door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna   take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
p66526
aS"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse   us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
p66527
aS'But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?'
p66528
aS'What do you think Pheebs?'
p66529
aS"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin   Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
p66530
aS'Yeah.'
p66531
aa(lp66532
S'She died.'
p66533
aS"You're kidding!"
p66534
aS"That's terrible!"
p66535
aS'Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across   the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the   wrong one.'
p66536
aS'Oh yeah?'
p66537
aS'Yeah, she was just an agent.'
p66538
aS"Joey's gonna be *so* upset."
p66539
aS'I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the   Atlantic.'
p66540
aS"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about   everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge."
p66541
aS"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
p66542
aa(lp66543
S"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get   used to everything else."
p66544
aS'What if he reads it in the paper?'
p66545
aS"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
p66546
aS"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas   party about two years ago."
p66547
aS'Oh right, uhm, Don?'
p66548
aS'Close. Ron.'
p66549
aS'Uh... What can I do for you?'
p66550
aS"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back."
p66551
aS'Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?'
p66552
aS"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll   see if she wants to come back."
p66553
aa(lp66554
S'Wow, that is tempting.'
p66555
aS"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face   it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that   true?"
p66556
aS'She is good!'
p66557
aS'Huh, I took a shot there.'
p66558
aS"But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah,   it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do."
p66559
aS'I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?'
p66560
aS'Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?'
p66561
aS'Oh, nothing, it\xe2\x80\x99s just, it\xe2\x80\x99s close to Ron. Does he.. Does   little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?'
p66562
aS"Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?"
p66563
aS'How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after   everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.   . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that\xe2\x80\x99s   not good. Let me start again. I\xe2\x80\x99m a paleontologist, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be there   with us and the touching refers only to bones\xe2\x80\xa6 fossils!'
p66564
aa(lp66565
S'You can really arrange that?'
p66566
aS'You let Rachel come back, and it\xe2\x80\x99s done.'
p66567
aS'Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worst thing   in the world.'
p66568
aS'Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,   your kid is going to have the time of his life.'
p66569
aS"That\xe2\x80\x99s great. I worry about little Ross. He\xe2\x80\x99s always   reading, he's collecting rocks and he\xe2\x80\x99s obsessed with dinosaurs."
p66570
aS'He\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.'
p66571
aS'Hey Phoebe.'
p66572
aS'Hey. Everything ok?'
p66573
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m just mad at my agent.'

aa(lp66576
S'There\xe2\x80\x99s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I   didn\xe2\x80\x99t even be put up for it! She\xe2\x80\x99d better have a good reason.'
p66577
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing she does.'
p66578

p66579
aS'Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you   will wait a minute before you call her.'
p66580
aS'Ok. Why?'

p66588

aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.'
p66591
aS'Don\xe2\x80\x99t take that tone with me. Who you   think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?'
p66592
aS'No, no, look. All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that you\xe2\x80\x99re my agent, ok?   And you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting me into any auditions and I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of it.'

aS'Yeah, I just\xe2\x80\xa6 I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be   killing her.'
p66625
aS'No, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.'
p66626
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to be taking it hard, I was like   her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing   he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she\xe2\x80\x99s not a great agent, but   she did stick with me for ten years. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call her and hire her again.'
p66627
aS"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call   you"
p66628
aS'Why?'
p66629
aS'Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...   is the key... to a happy heart.'
p66630
aa(lp66631
S'You blow me away.'
p66632
aS"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her   to call you?"
p66633
aS'I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.'
p66634
aS'And yet I never run into Beyonce!'
p66635
aS'You two know each other?'
p66636
aS"Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man   out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna   have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie"
p66637
aS"Don't, don't!"
p66638
aS"No, actually, we're buying the house next door."
p66639
aS'Why!?'
p66640
aS"I don't know   why."
p66641
aa(lp66642
S"Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.   But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to   get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk   numbers."
p66643
aS'This can not be happening!'
p66644
aS"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.   Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will."
p66645
aS'The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple   are the Hitlers.'
p66646
aS'Okay, Okay,    All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house   into a guest house.'
p66647
aS"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,   but when did you start crapping money!?"
p66648
aS'Okay, you come up with an idea.'
p66649
aS'Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on   our house. We can still get out.'
p66650
aS'But we love our house.'
p66651
aS'Will we love it so much with her next door? And she\'s gonna be louder   out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!'
p66652
aa(lp66653
S"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever   we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.   I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls   jump back up inside your body."
p66654
aS"Well, we   have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too."
p66655
aS'Who is it?'
p66656
aS"It's me. Ron.    Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might   be able to get her to come back."
p66657
aS'This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,   is not my main job.'
p66658
aS'Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?'
p66659
aS'Not good, Ron.'
p66660
aS'Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.'
p66661
aS"Wow, that's   pretty cool"
p66662
aS'Huh? So? We have a deal?'
p66663
aa(lp66664
S'Okay, you got it.'
p66665
aS'Yes! yes!'
p66666
aS'This is gonna make me very popular.'
p66667
aS'Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!'
p66668
aS'I meant with my son.'
p66669
aS"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much."
p66670
aS'Oh my God.  Hello?'
p66671
aS"Joey,   it's Estelle."
p66672
aS'Estelle?'
p66673
aS"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for   firing me."
p66674
aa(lp66675
S"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
p66676
aS"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
p66677
aS"No, no, no!  Don't drop by,   don't drop by!"
p66678
aS"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay."
p66679
aS"Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?"
p66680
aS"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with   the career. You're gonna be huge."
p66681
aS'Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.    "out of area". Boy, I\'ll say.'
p66682
aS'The Hitlers will be so disappointed.'
p66683
aS"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see   you later, neighbor."
p66684
aS"Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to   be here."
p66685
aa(lp66686
S'Oh, me too...'
p66687
aS'Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.'
p66688
aS'Huh?'
p66689
aS'I never stopped loving you.'
p66690
aS'Oh... my...'
p66691
aS'Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice   Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.'
p66692
aS'Chandler, what are you talking about?'
p66693
aS'Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and   Monica never have to know a thing.'
p66694
aS"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...   heat between us."
p66695
aS'Obviously.'
p66696
aa(lp66697
S"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't   think we should get this house now."
p66698
aS"Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away."
p66699
aS'Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.'
p66700
aS'I understand.'
p66701
aS'Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  Goodbye Chandler Bing.'
p66702
aS"They're never coming down now."
p66703
aS'Hi!'
p66704
aS'Hey!'
p66705
aS'You are never going to believe what happened to me today.'
p66706
aS'What?'
p66707
aa(lp66708
S'Ralph Lauren called again and they offered   me more money.'
p66709
aS'They did?'
p66710
aS"Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll   do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I   don't even know what department that guy's in."
p66711
aS'So, what are you gonna do?'
p66712
aS'Well, I took it.'
p66713
aS"That's great! So you're staying in New York!"
p66714
aS'YAY! WHOO! YAY!'
p66715
aS"You're excited, right?"
p66716
aS"Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.   It's certainly the easier choice..."
p66717
aS'Right!'
p66718
aa(lp66719
S"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to   Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital   of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's   fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of   that I possibly can..."
p66720
aS"Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.   Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
p66721
aS'Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when   I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...   But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.'
p66722
aS'You should go.'
p66723
aS'What?'
p66724
aS"It's what you want. You should go."
p66725
aS'You really think so?'
p66726
aS'I really do.'
p66727
aS'But I already told Zelner that I would come back...'
p66728
aS"I'm sure he'll   understand."
p66729
aa(lp66730
S"All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris."
p66731
aS'Yeah...'
p66732
aS"Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!"
p66733
aS'Yeah, yeah, oh!'
p66734
aS"Oh! Oh, I'm so happy."
p66735
aS"Then I'm happy too."
p66736
aS"Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects   to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...    ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.  Dude, where's   my speech?  That is   entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody."
p66737
aS"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris."
p66738
aS"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose."
p66739
aS'Just flip!'
p66740
aa(lp66741
S'Ha, tails!'
p66742
aS'Damnit!'
p66743
aS'Hey!'
p66744
aS'Hey!'
p66745
aS"So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven."
p66746
aS'Oh, that sounds good!'
p66747
aS"Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?"
p66748
aS"It's all done!"
p66749
aS'Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.'
p66750
aS"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane..."
p66751
aa(lp66752
S"Ok,  so you've done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?"
p66753
aS'Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.'
p66754
aS'Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!'
p66755
aS"Where's your passport?"
p66756
aS'It should be right next to my plane ticket.'
p66757
aS"Well, it's not."
p66758
aS"What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!"
p66759
aS'Here, let me help you.'
p66760
aS"Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!"
p66761
aS'At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?'
p66762
aa(lp66763
S"Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?"
p66764
aS'I know.'
p66765
aS"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?"
p66766
aS"No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out."
p66767
aS'Hey!'
p66768
aS'Hi.'
p66769
aS"Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten."
p66770
aS"That's because I'm pregnant!"
p66771
aS'Right, no, I understand.'
p66772
aS"Oh, ok.  I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts."
p66773
aa(lp66774
S'No, no, I knew .'
p66775
aS'Okay, well, stop staring at them.'
p66776
aS"She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!"
p66777
aS"Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel."
p66778
aS'Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.'
p66779
aS"Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?"
p66780
aS"Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense."
p66781
aS'Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!'
p66782
aS"Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product..."
p66783
aS"Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants."
p66784
aa(lp66785
S"I'll be right back."
p66786
aS"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place."
p66787
aS"Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name."
p66788
aS'No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?'
p66789
aS'Yeah, it takes two incomes.'
p66790
aS'Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.'
p66791
aS"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room."
p66792
aS'Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.'
p66793
aS'Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.'
p66794
aS'What are you guys doing?'
p66795
aa(lp66796
S"Try it, I can't feel a thing!"
p66797
aS'Are, are you kidding? This is packing?'
p66798
aS"We're taking a break!"
p66799
aS'From?'
p66800
aS'Jumping on the bed?'
p66801
aS"All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!"
p66802
aS"You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!"
p66803
aS"No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs."
p66804
aS'You guys hear a ringing?'
p66805
aS'What the hell is this?'
p66806
aa(lp66807
S"Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!"
p66808
aS"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out."
p66809
aS"I didn't know Monica had these!"
p66810
aS'Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!'
p66811
aS'Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!'
p66812
aS'Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.'
p66813
aS'Hey!'
p66814
aS"Hey! Where's Mike?"
p66815
aS'Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.'
p66816
aS'Yeah? Yeah, where is it?'
p66817
aa(lp66818
S"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party."
p66819
aS'Rock on!'
p66820
aS'Wow, this is quite a spread!  What is all this stuff?'
p66821
aS"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange."
p66822
aS'Hey.'
p66823
aS'Hey.'
p66824
aS"Hey, where's Rach?"
p66825
aS"Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second."
p66826
aS'Great.'
p66827
aS"Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?"
p66828
aa(lp66829
S'Yeah.'
p66830
aS'Hey Rach, hey you.'
p66831
aS'Here she is!'
p66832
aS'Hi you guys!'
p66833
aS'What did I just say?'
p66834
aS"No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine."
p66835
aS"Come here, I'll make you a drink."
p66836
aS"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?"
p66837
aS"I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!"
p66838
aS'You know, I had a chance to stop her too!'
p66839
aa(lp66840
S'Yeah?'

p66842
aS'Yes, Joe?'
p66843
aS'I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!'
p66844
aS'You doing ok?'
p66845
aS"Well, I've been better."
p66846
aS'Uh-hmm.'
p66847
aS'You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?'
p66848
aS'Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!'
p66849
aS"I'm gonna miss you so much."
p66850
aa(lp66851
S'I know.'
p66852
aS'You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .'
p66853
aS"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
p66854
aS"Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
p66855
aS"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start."
p66856
aS"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,   but I do have something for you."
p66857
aS'Oh, oh. . What is this?'
p66858
aS"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!"
p66859
aS"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!"
p66860
aS'Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.'
p66861
aa(lp66862
S'Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!'
p66863
aS"What are you talking about? These aren't mine."
p66864
aS'Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!'
p66865
aS"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before."
p66866
aS'Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?'
p66867
aS'Rachel used to live in that room.'
p66868
aS'Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!'
p66869

p66885
aS"She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually."
p66886
aS'Are you kidding? Oh my God...'
p66887
aS"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
p66888
aS"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations."
p66889
aS"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me..."
p66890
aS"I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too."
p66891

aa(lp66894
S'What?'
p66895
aS'I... I... I...'
p66896
aS'That is so sweet.'
p66897
aS"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing."
p66898
aS'Uh, Rach?'
p66899
aS"Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her."
p66900
aS'I really made you think about that thing uh?'
p66901
aS'Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.'
p66902
aS"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get."
p66903
aS"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room."
p66904
aa(lp66905
S"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with..."
p66906
aS"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
p66907
aS"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
p66908
aS'Pheebs!'
p66909
aS'Yeah!'
p66910
aS'I think these are yours.'
p66911
aS"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
p66912
aS'Can I talk to you alone for a minute?'
p66913
aS"Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?"
p66914
aS'Where do you think Mike really is?'
p66915
aa(lp66916
S'Oh honey...'
p66917
aS"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
p66918
aS"Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you."
p66919
aS"Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance."

aS'Okay. Oh...'
p66921
aS'Oh!'
p66922
aS"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't."
p66923
aS"So, I guess you're next. You're ready?"
p66924
aS"I don't think so."
p66925
aS"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years."
p66926
aa(lp66927
S"You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news."
p66928
aS'That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.'
p66929
aS"God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?"
p66930
aS"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well."
p66931
aS'No, no, no, no!'
p66932
aS'Okay, here we go...'
p66933
aS'Oh...  Well...'
p66934
aS'Yeah...'
p66935
aS"I think I'm gonna take off."
p66936
aS'Huh?'
p66937
aa(lp66938
S'Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.'
p66939
aS"What? I don't get a goodbye?"
p66940
aS'Lucky bastard!'
p66941
aS'Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.'
p66942
aS'Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.'
p66943
aS'Well, it needs to be plicit.'
p66944
aS"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?"
p66945
aS"No, I don't think so."
p66946
aS'You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.'
p66947
aS'Yeah. Mine too.'
p66948
aa(lp66949
S'Mine was a humdinger'
p66950
aS"O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU!"
p66951
aS"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
p66952
aS'And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he\'s got more pride than that.'
p66953
aS'THE HELL I DO!'
p66954
aS"I don't get a goodbye?"
p66955
aS'What?'
p66956
aS'Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.'
p66957
aS'Ross...'
p66958
aS"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris."
p66959
aa(lp66960
S"I hope Ross isn't too upset."
p66961
aS"I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am."
p66962
aS'Tell me about it.'
p66963
aS"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
p66964
aS"All right, I think I'm gonna head out."
p66965
aS"Uh, where do you think you're going?"
p66966
aS"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here."
p66967
aS"We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in."
p66968
aS'Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.'
p66969
aS'Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.'
p66970
aa(lp66971
S'Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.'
p66972
aS"You couldn't be cool."
p66973
aS"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?"
p66974
aS'Yeah.'
p66975
aS'Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.'
p66976
aS'Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.'
p66977
aS'You did? How?'
p66978
aS'Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.'
p66979
aS'Oh my God! Let me see.'
p66980
aS"Who's that dirty old lady?"
p66981
aa(lp66982
S"Monica's grandmother."
p66983
aS'Nana liked it rough!'
p66984
aS'Hi!'
p66985
aS'Hey!'
p66986
aS'Come on here, have a seat.'
p66987
aS'How was your night?'
p66988
aS'Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh...  Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.'
p66989
aS'Erica, are you okay?'
p66990
aS'Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.'
p66991
aS'Oh my God!'
p66992
aa(lp66993
S'Relax! We just get her some antacids.'
p66994
aS"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."
p66995
aS'Oh my God!'
p66996
aS'Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.'
p66997
aS"All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!"
p66998
aS"Honey, it's gonna be okay."
p66999
aS'You can do this. Just breathe.'
p67000
aS'Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.'
p67001
aS'Ooh! Are you sure?'
p67002
aS"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone."
p67003
aa(lp67004
S'Chandler, wait, wait, wait...'
p67005
aS'What?'
p67006
aS'If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.'
p67007
aS"You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?"
p67008
aS"That's what it seemed like."
p67009
aS'I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.'
p67010
aS"Fine, then why didn't you say something?"
p67011
aS"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!"
p67012
aS'Rach!'
p67013
aS'What?'
p67014
aa(lp67015
S"You keep, you keep... You can't..."
p67016
aS'WHAT?'
p67017
aS'A little more.'
p67018
aS'Okay.'
p67019
aS"A little more, a little more.  A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this."
p67020
aS'All right, ready?'
p67021
aS'Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.'
p67022
aS'All right, here it goes...'
p67023
aS"Doesn't work..."
p67024
aS'Previously on Friends.'
p67025
aa(lp67026
S'Erica, are you okay?'
p67027
aS'Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these   stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.'
p67028
aS'Oh my God!'
p67029
aS"Relax! We'll just get her some antacids."
p67030
aS"She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!"
p67031
aS'Oh my God!'
p67032
aS"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't   mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you   mean more to me."
p67033
aS'Rach!'
p67034
aS'What?!'
p67035
aS'Hey.'
p67036
aa(lp67037
S'Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.'
p67038
aS'Oh. This was amazing.'
p67039
aS"It really was. You've learned some new moves!"
p67040
aS'Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a   joke.'
p67041
aS'Ah.'
p67042
aS"Who's laughing now?"
p67043
aS'I know!'
p67044
aS'Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.'
p67045
aS'Next time, can I say breathe?'
p67046
aS'No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can   I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?'
p67047
aa(lp67048
S"No, I'm okay."
p67049
aS"Alright, I'll be right back."
p67050
aS'Where are you going?'
p67051
aS'To use the bathroom.'
p67052
aS"You can't leave me alone with her."
p67053
aS'What?'
p67054
aS'This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not   comfortable with!'
p67055
aS'What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?'
p67056
aS"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone   together."
p67057
aS"You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two   minutes."
p67058
aa(lp67059
S'Okay.'
p67060
aS'So, ah... Any plans for the summer?'
p67061
aS"I don't know. Maybe church-camp?"
p67062
aS'Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which   is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?'
p67063
aS'What?'
p67064
aS"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will   ever know, because no one can experience both."
p67065
aS"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who   knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this."
p67066
aS'Morning.'
p67067
aS'Hey!'
p67068
aS"What's that?"
p67069
aa(lp67070
S"It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler."
p67071
aS"It's a baby chick and duck!"
p67072
aS'Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.'
p67073
aS'I did not see that coming.'
p67074
aS"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It   has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to   that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to."
p67075
aS'Yes.'
p67076
aS"Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there."
p67077
aS'That is the rule, though.'
p67078
aS"Guess what? You're almost an uncle!"
p67079
aS'What?'
p67080
aa(lp67081
S'Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are   at the hospital right now!'
p67082
aS'Oh my God!'
p67083
aS"Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl."
p67084
aS'Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.'
p67085
aS'Have you seen him throw a ball?'
p67086
aS'Is Rachel here?'
p67087
aS"Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you   guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you."
p67088
aS"Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out."
p67089
aS"What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?"
p67090
aS"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have   sex and shut up. We totally did it!"
p67091
aa(lp67092
S'Oh my God. You and Rachel?'
p67093
aS"I know, it's pretty great."
p67094
aS'So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?'
p67095
aS"Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk."
p67096
aS'But do you wanna get back together?'
p67097
aS"I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.   When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know   what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together."
p67098
aS'YAY!'
p67099
aS'Shhh!'
p67100
aS'Yay!'
p67101
aS'So, so is she still going to Paris?'
p67102
aa(lp67103
S"Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not."
p67104
aS'Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get   back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are   chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I\'m in a musical!    "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And   the moon comes..."'
p67105
aS'Morning!'
p67106
aS"Guess we'll never know how it ends."
p67107
aS'Okay.'
p67108
aS'Hey.'
p67109
aS'Hey.'
p67110
aS'Hey. How did you sleep?'
p67111
aS'Good. You?'
p67112
aS'Good.'
p67113
aa(lp67114
S'I bet you did!'
p67115
aS'Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?'
p67116
aS'Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?'
p67117
aS"Chick and the duck? Didn't they die..."
p67118
aS'Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on   the farm.'
p67119
aS'So...'
p67120
aS'Morning.'
p67121
aS'You too. Last night was just wonderful.'
p67122
aS'It really was.'
p67123
aS'I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.'
p67124
aa(lp67125
S"I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those   things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's   everything you want it to be."
p67126
aS'Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.'
p67127
aS"It's just a little bit more, honey."
p67128
aS'Help me! This hurts!'
p67129
aS'Is it really that bad?'
p67130
aS"Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which   is worse!"
p67131
aS"The baby's head is crowning."
p67132
aS'Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have   ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!'
p67133
aS"I'm okay."
p67134
aS"Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your   child! It's the miracle of life!"
p67135
aa(lp67136
S'Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.'
p67137
aS'Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...'
p67138
aS"It's a... It's a boy!"
p67139
aS'Wow!'
p67140
aS'Is he okay?'
p67141
aS"He's just fine."
p67142
aS'Oh, you did it!'
p67143
aS"It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some  other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see."
p67144
aS'Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?'
p67145
aS"Well, that's spongy."
p67146
aa(lp67147
S"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky!"
p67148
aS'I know. He has your eyes.'
p67149
aS"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does."
p67150
aS"We'll just get him cleaned up a bit."
p67151
aS'Okay.'
p67152
aS"Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much."
p67153
aS"I'm really happy for you guys."
p67154
aS'How do you feel?'
p67155
aS"I'm tired!"
p67156
aS"Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one   will be along in a minute."
p67157
aa(lp67158
S"I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
p67159
aS'The next baby should be along in a minute.'
p67160
aS'We only ordered one!'
p67161
aS"You know it's twins, right?"
p67162
aS'Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!'
p67163
aS"I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never   happened before."
p67164
aS'Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.'
p67165
aS'Wait, did you know it was twins?'
p67166
aS"Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in   Ohio."
p67167
aS'Anybody tell you?'
p67168
aa(lp67169
S"I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about   two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They   kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well,   that's good 'cause I'm having a baby."
p67170
aS'This is unbelievable.'
p67171
aS'Twins actually run in my family.'
p67172
aS'Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?'
p67173
aS'What do we do?'
p67174
aS'What do you mean "what do we do"?'
p67175
aS'Twins! Twins!!'
p67176
aS"Chandler, you're panicking!"
p67177
aS"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
p67178
aS"We can't split them up!"
p67179
aa(lp67180
S"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and   then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean,   that's a great day for everybody."
p67181
aS'Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?'
p67182
aS"What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?"
p67183
aS'Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.'
p67184
aS'Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!'
p67185
aS'That doesn\'t matter! We have waited so long for this. I don\'t   care if it\'s two babies. I don\'t care if it\'s three babies! I don\'t   care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We   are taking them home, because they are our children!'
p67186
aS'Okay. Shhh...'
p67187
aS'Okay.'
p67188
aS'Okay!'
p67189
aS'Okay!'
p67190
aa(lp67191
S"It looks like we're about ready over here."
p67192
aS'Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.'
p67193
aS'Ow!'
p67194
aS'Here she comes!'
p67195
aS"She? It's a girl?"
p67196
aS'Yeah.'
p67197
aS"Well, now we have one of each!    And that's enough!"
p67198
aS'And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.'
p67199
aS'Oh my God! What did you say?'
p67200
aS'Nothing! What do you say to that?'
p67201
aa(lp67202
S"Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!"
p67203
aS'No way!'
p67204
aS"You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?"
p67205
aS'What?'
p67206
aS"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language."
p67207
aS"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If   she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go."
p67208
aS'You really think so?'
p67209
aS'I\'m telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical   where there\'d be a really good convincing song.  "Bam-bam,   don\'t take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don\'t let love fly away.   Bam-bam-bam-bam..."'
p67210
aS'Hi!'
p67211
aS"Can't a girl finish a song around here?"
p67212
aa(lp67213
S'Hey!'
p67214
aS"Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's."
p67215
aS'Okay.'
p67216
aS"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
p67217
aS'No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and   then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.'
p67218
aS'Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.'
p67219
aS'Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about   Atkins? Good luck, Emma!'
p67220
aS"Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her  how I feel."
p67221
aS'Ross, wait!'
p67222
aS'What? What?'
p67223
aa(lp67224
S'Could you get me a muffin?'
p67225
aS'Rachel?'
p67226
aS'Yeah?'
p67227
aS"I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell  you. I love you."
p67228
aS"I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I  thought you should know."
p67229
aS"Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the  same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf\xc3\xa9, having coffee, or I  see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw."
p67230
aS'Oh... Bye guys.'
p67231
aS'Oh my God!'
p67232
aS'Unbelievable!'
p67233
aS'Hey, you know what might help?'
p67234
aa(lp67235
S"I'm not getting you a muffin!"
p67236
aS'Do you think they recognize each other from in there?'
p67237
aS"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in   apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're   pushed through a vagina and they meet."
p67238
aS"We're going to take Erica to recovery now."
p67239
aS"There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name   the girl-baby Erica."
p67240
aS"Oh my God, that's just like my name!"
p67241
aS'Son of a gun, it is!'
p67242
aS"Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I   picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler."
p67243
aS'Okay, well, bye!'
p67244
aS'Bye!'
p67245
aa(lp67246
S'Bye!'
p67247
aS"We'll call you!"
p67248
aS'Okay.'
p67249
aS'Have fun at church-camp!'
p67250
aS'Oh, look at these little bunnies!'
p67251
aS'I know! You ready to trade?'
p67252
aS'Okay.'
p67253
aS'Okay.'
p67254
aS"Alright, let's see.."
p67255
aS'We could trade later.'
p67256
aa(lp67257
S"Yeah, I'm good."
p67258
aS'Hey, what are you working on?'
p67259
aS'It\'s a... It\'s a "welcome home" sign for the baby.'
p67260
aS'How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?'
p67261
aS'No, I sat in the paint.'
p67262
aS'Hey.'
p67263
aS'Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?'
p67264
aS"No, and I'm not going to."
p67265
aS'What?'
p67266
aS'Why not?'
p67267
aa(lp67268
S"Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what   happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun."
p67269
aS"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's   sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you   slept together last night."
p67270
aS"Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is."
p67271
aS'Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...'
p67272
aS'Uh, Joe?'
p67273
aS'Damn it!'
p67274
aS"Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now.   Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time."
p67275
aS"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet   somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's...   It's a city of Gunthers!"
p67276
aS'Hey!'
p67277
aS'Hey! What do you have there?'
p67278
aa(lp67279
S"Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it,   it'd be better, but.."
p67280
aS'Oh my God! You did that yourself?'
p67281
aS"Honey, that's gorgeous!"
p67282
aS"You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
p67283
aS"Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe  they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the  baby!"
p67284
aS"Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here  any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise."
p67285
aS"Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's  baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard."
p67286
aS'Oh my God!'
p67287
aS'Oh my God!'
p67288
aS'Hi! Oh my gosh!'
p67289
aa(lp67290
S'Hey.'
p67291
aS'Hey.'
p67292
aS'Hey, so what is the big surprise?'
p67293
aS'Oh.'
p67294
aS'Oh my God!'
p67295
aS'What... What...'
p67296
aS'Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two,   right?'
p67297
aS"Yes, it's twins!"
p67298
aS'Oh my God.'
p67299
aS"Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?"
p67300
aa(lp67301
S"This is a boy,  and that's a girl."
p67302
aS'Her name is Erica.'
p67303
aS'Aw..'
p67304
aS"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica."
p67305
aS"Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time  together."
p67306
aS'Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.'
p67307
aS"Aw, he's gonna be so happy."
p67308
aS'Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a \'40s  newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I\'m gonna blow  this story wide open!"'
p67309
aS'Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.'
p67310
aS'I want one.'
p67311
aa(lp67312
S"Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my  coat."
p67313
aS'Seriously. Wanna make one of those?'
p67314
aS'One? How about a whole bunch?'
p67315
aS'Really?'
p67316
aS'Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the  Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda  dull.'
p67317
aS"Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm  gonna miss my plane."
p67318
aS"I'm just so glad you got to see the babies."
p67319
aS"Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch  you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you  guys again. I love you all so much."
p67320
aS'I love you.'
p67321
aS'I love you.'
p67322
aa(lp67323
S'Call us when you get there.'
p67324
aS'I will. Ross, come here.'
p67325
aS"I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it."
p67326
aS'Neither will I.'
p67327
aS"Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're   gonna really hate me over there."
p67328
aS'So, you just let her go?'
p67329
aS'Yeah.'
p67330
aS"Hey, maybe that's for the best."
p67331
aS'Yeah?'
p67332
aS'Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think   about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping   together was the perfect way to say goodbye?'
p67333
aa(lp67334
S"But now she'll never know how he feels!"
p67335
aS"Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way?   I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so  long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  Right?"
p67336
aS'Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get  over her.'
p67337
aS"Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her."
p67338
aS'What?'
p67339
aS"I don't! I wanna be with her."
p67340
aS'Really?'
p67341
aS"Yeah, I'm gonna go after her."
p67342
aS'Yeah, you are!'
p67343
aS'Woo!'
p67344
aa(lp67345
S'Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!'
p67346
aS'My coat...'
p67347
aS'This is so cool!'
p67348
aS"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
p67349
aS"But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to  say?"
p67350
aS"I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least  I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.  Where - where is my coat?!"
p67351
aS"You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to  the airport."
p67352
aS'Okay, guys, wish me luck.'
p67353
aS'Hurry!'
p67354
aS'Good luck, good luck!'
p67355
aa(lp67356
S"There's no seatbelt!"
p67357
aS"That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode,   so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car."
p67358
aS"Alright, alright, let's do this!"
p67359
aS'Okay!'
p67360
aS'Hey!'
p67361
aS'18th and East End.'
p67362
aS"I - I don't take passengers."
p67363
aS'Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.'
p67364
aS"No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab."
p67365
aS"Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?"
p67366
aa(lp67367
S'My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"'
p67368
aS'What?'
p67369
aS'Get out of the cab!'
p67370
aS'Get out of the cab!'
p67371
aS'Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present   now?'
p67372
aS'Now, that you can do.'
p67373
aS'Alright!'
p67374
aS"Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!"
p67375
aS'You can open your eyes now.'
p67376
aS'Are we off the bridge?'
p67377
aa(lp67378
S'Yes.'
p67379
aS'Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?'
p67380
aS'Yes, she jumped right back up.'
p67381
aS'Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!'
p67382
aS'Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?'
p67383
aS"Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!"
p67384
aS'You should have thought of that before you got in!'
p67385
aS'Toll-booth.'
p67386
aS'What?'
p67387
aS'Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the   glove compartment.'
p67388
aa(lp67389
S'Hurry!'
p67390
aS'Okay!'
p67391
aS'Okay.'
p67392
aS'Damn, that window is clean.'
p67393
aS'Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...'
p67394
aS'We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but  now we understand you were doing this.'
p67395
aS'Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!'
p67396
aS'Really? You got us a chick and a duck?'
p67397
aS'Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.  Bird feces.'
p67398
aS"Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now  they're gone!"
p67399
aa(lp67400
S"Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
p67401
aS"Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins."
p67402
aS'Alright.'
p67403
aS'Oh God! What did I just step on?'
p67404
aS'Oh!'
p67405
aS"It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
p67406
aS'Oh..'
p67407
aS'You stepped on my egg roll?'
p67408
aS"I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the   floor."
p67409
aS'Just put it on a plate and leave.'
p67410
aa(lp67411
S"Okay, let's find these birds."
p67412
aS'Alright.'
p67413
aS'Wait, wait. Do you hear that?'
p67414
aS"Oh! They're in the table!"
p67415
aS"Well, that can't be good!"
p67416
aS'We gotta get them out of there!'
p67417
aS'How?'
p67418
aS'Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?'
p67419
aS"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
p67420
aS'Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.'
p67421
aa(lp67422
S'Joey, wait! The ball!'
p67423
aS'Oh!'
p67424
aS'Oh God! So what do we do?'
p67425
aS"I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow."
p67426
aS'Okay.'
p67427
aS"No... It's all glued together."
p67428
aS'Does that mean we have to bust it open?'
p67429
aS"I don't know. Maybe."
p67430
aS'Oh my God!'
p67431
aS"I know! It's.. It's the foosball table."
p67432
aa(lp67433
S'All right, you know what? We don\'t have a choice. It\'s like I would   have said in that sci-fi movie if I\'d gotten the part. "Those are our   men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the   most important thing in my life; my time-machine."'
p67434
aS'Did that movie ever get made?'
p67435
aS'It did not.'
p67436
aS'Ross, where are you going?'
p67437
aS"To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the   death-cab?"
p67438
aS'What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have   you never chased anyone through the airport before?'
p67439
aS'Not since my cop-show got cancelled.'
p67440
aS'You have to get a ticket to get past security.'
p67441
aS"What? We're never gonna make it!"
p67442
aS'Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!'
p67443
aa(lp67444
S"Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great."
p67445
aS'Madame, your passport   please?'
p67446
aS"Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my   high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!"
p67447
aS'Your boarding pass, please.'
p67448
aS'Oh.'
p67449
aS"Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this."
p67450
aS"Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass..."
p67451
aS"I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it,   but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size."
p67452
aS'Madame, you must have your boarding pass..'
p67453
aS'Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.'
p67454
aa(lp67455
S'Hey, I need a ticket.'
p67456
aS"Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get   to see how it works out?"
p67457
aS'Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.'
p67458
aS"We're on our honeymoon."
p67459
aS'And the destination?'
p67460
aS"I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest."
p67461
aS"I'm so lucky I married you."
p67462
aS'Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found   it!'
p67463
aS"Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person."
p67464
aS"Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?"
p67465
aa(lp67466
S'No, did we miss it?'
p67467
aS"No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20   minutes."
p67468
aS'Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.'
p67469
aS'Hello.'
p67470
aS"Hey, it's me. Here's Ross."
p67471
aS'What? Hey, hey, listen..'
p67472
aS"Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises   the twins are making. Listen."
p67473
aS'Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?'
p67474
aS"Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before."
p67475
aS"That's alright. Listen, listen."
p67476
aa(lp67477
S'Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.'
p67478
aS'Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?'
p67479
aS"Isn't that cute?"
p67480
aS"That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information."
p67481
aS"Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40."
p67482
aS"Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board."
p67483
aS"That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark   airport."
p67484
aS'What?'
p67485
aS'Newark airport. Why, where are you?'
p67486
aS'JFK.'
p67487
aa(lp67488
S"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of   there."
p67489
aS"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
p67490
aS'Okay. Here goes.'
p67491
aS"What's the matter?"
p67492
aS'I need to say goodbye to the table first.'
p67493
aS'I understand.'
p67494
aS'Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you   guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You   guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?'
p67495
aS"I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game,   good game, good game, good game, good game."
p67496
aS"Okay, here we go. I can't do it."
p67497
aS"Well, I can't do it either."
p67498
aa(lp67499
S'Hey! Did you find them?'
p67500
aS"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
p67501
aS'We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!'
p67502
aS"Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!"
p67503
aS'Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!'
p67504
aS"Well, I've never gone this fast before."
p67505
aS"Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away.   There's no way we're gonna make it in time."
p67506
aS"She's got her cell, you could call her."
p67507
aS'I am not doing this over the phone.'
p67508
aS"You don't have any other choice!"
p67509
aa(lp67510
S'Hello?'
p67511
aS'Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the   plane?'
p67512
aS'Yeah.'
p67513
aS"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
p67514
aS'Yay.'
p67515
aS'Uh, Rach, hang on.'
p67516
aS'Phoebe? Is everything okay?'
p67517
aS"Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane."
p67518
aS'What? Why?'
p67519
aS"I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something   is wrong with the left Philange."
p67520
aa(lp67521
S"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane."
p67522
aS'Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you   the minute I get to Paris.'
p67523
aS'Uhm, what was that?'
p67524
aS'Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get   off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something   wrong with the left Philange.'
p67525
aS"Okay, that doesn't sound good."
p67526
aS"I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff   like this, and you know what? She's almost never right."
p67527
aS'But she is sometimes.'
p67528
aS'Well...'
p67529
aS'Wait, what are you doing?'
p67530
aS"Well, I can't take this plane now."
p67531
aa(lp67532
S'Excuse me, sir, where are you going?'
p67533
aS"I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a   feeling something's wrong with the left Philange."
p67534
aS'Could I get some peanuts?'
p67535
aS"What's wrong with the plane?"
p67536
aS"There's nothing wrong with the plane."
p67537
aS'Yeah! The left Philange!'
p67538
aS'There is no Philange!'
p67539
aS"Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!"
p67540
aS"I'm not flying on it!"
p67541
aS"Ma'am, please sit down!"
p67542
aa(lp67543
S"What's going on?"
p67544
aS"We're all getting off. There is no Philange!"
p67545
aS'This is ridiculous! I...'
p67546
aS'Yeah, okay.'
p67547
aS'Alright. My job here is done.'
p67548
aS'That was... Impressive.'
p67549
aS"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
p67550
aS"Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get   back to the babies. I'll see you girls later."
p67551
aS'Sorry about the table, man.'
p67552
aS'Yeah.'
p67553
aa(lp67554
S'You gonna buy a new one?'
p67555
aS"Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play   after you go."
p67556
aS'Well, at least we got these little guys out.'
p67557
aS'Yeah.'
p67558
aS'Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get   used to things crapping in my hand, huh?'
p67559
aS"I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds   around again."
p67560
aS'Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.'
p67561
aS'What?'
p67562
aS"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus,   here they'd have their own room."
p67563
aS'I could get a goose!'
p67564
aa(lp67565
S"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
p67566
aS"Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to   stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a   reason to come visit."
p67567
aS'I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame   cool guy handshake?'
p67568
aS'Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.'
p67569
aS"Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine."
p67570
aS'And you fixed the Philange?'
p67571
aS'Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we   put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.'
p67572
aS'Where is she?'
p67573
aS"I don't see her."
p67574
aS'Rachel! Rachel Green!'
p67575
aa(lp67576
S'There she is!'
p67577
aS'Rachel! Rachel!'
p67578
aS'Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?'
p67579
aS'No, no, I just have to talk to someone.'
p67580
aS"I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a   boarding pass."
p67581
aS'No, no, no, but...'
p67582
aS'RACHEL!!'
p67583
aS'Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?'

It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you,   and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And   now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have   said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love   you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you.   What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get   off this plane."
